# Files
* data: the sample data extracted from [20 Newsgroups](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/) which is just used to run the code. __Note__: this is not the dataset used in the paper as those datasets are not avaible for public distribute.  
* reranking_main.py
* methods

# Running the code
* Set up the parameters in reranking_main.py
* Excute reranking.py
