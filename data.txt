Ironically, the Israeli government justifies its occupation in Lebanon by claiming that it is necessary to prevent such bombardments of Israeli villages!! Congratulations to the brave men of the Lebanese resistance! With every Israeli son that you place in the grave you are underlining the moral bankruptcy of Israel's occupation and drawing attention to the Israeli government's policy of reckless disregard for civilian life. Brad Hernlem (hernlem@chess.ncsu.EDU) Very nice. Three people are murdered, and Bradly is overjoyed. When I hear about deaths in the middle east, be it Jewish or Arab deaths, I feel sadness, and only hope that soon this all stops. Apparently, my view point is not acceptable to people like you Bradly. Hernlem, you disgust me. Harry.

Of course posting some hard evidence or facts is much more difficult. You have not bothered to substantiate this in any way. Basil, do you know of any evidence that would support this? I can just imagine a news report from ancient times, if Hasan had been writing it. Newsflash: Cairo AP (Ancient Press). Israel today denied Egypt acces to the Red Sea. In a typical display of Israelite agressiveness, the leader of the Israelite slave revolt, former prince Moses, parted the Red Sea. The action is estimated to have caused irreparable damage to the environment. Egyptian authorities have said that thousands of fisherman have been denied their livelihood by the parted waters. Pharaoh's brave charioteers were successful in their glorious attempt to cause the waters of the Red Sea to return to their normal state. Unfortunately they suffered heavy casualties while doing so. |> Hasan -- Shai Guday | Stealth bombers, OS Software Engineer | Thinking Machines Corp. | the winged ninjas of the skies. Cambridge, MA |

First, my above statement doesnot say that "the existence of israeli citizens in the WB revoke their right of life" but it says "the israeli occupation of the WB revoke the right of life for some/most its citizens - basically revokes the right of for its military men". Clearly, occupation is an undeclared war; during war, attacks against military targets are fully legitimate. Ok, let me re-phrase the question. I have repeatedly asked you if the Israelis have less human rights than the palestinians, and if so, why. From your posting (where you did not directly adress my question) I inferred that you thought so. Together with the above statement I then assumed that the reason was the actions of the state of Israel. Re: your statement of occupation: I'd like you to define the term, so I don't have to repeat this 'drag the answer out of hasan' procedure more than neccesary. Secondly, surely israeli have human rights, but they ask their goverment to protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories, not by further oppressing Palestinean human rights. I'm sorry, but the above sentence does not make sense. Please rephrase it. |> If a state can deprive all it's citizens of human rights by its actions, then |> tell me why _any_ human living today should have any rights at all?

The distinction is not trivial. Murder happens to innocent people, not people whose line of work is to kill or be killed. It just so happened that these soldiers, in the line of duty, were killed by the opposition. And resistance is different from terrorism. Certainly the athletes in Munich were victims of terrorists (though some might call them freedom fighters). Their deaths cannot be compared to those of soldiers who are killed by resistance fighters. Don't forget that it was the French Resistance to the Nazi occupying forces which eventually succeeded in driving out the hostile occupiers in WWII. Diplomacy has not worked with Israel and the Lebanese people are tired of being occupied! They are now turning to the only option they see as viable. (Don't forget that it worked in driving out the US) -marc -- ______________________________________________________________________________ Some people are so narrow minded they can see through a crack in a door with both eyes.

Accounts of Anti-Armenian Human Right Violations in Azerbaijan #014 Prelude to Current Events in Nagorno-Karabakh +----------------------------------------------------------+ | | | I asked, "What's going on?" He says, "What's the matter, | | can't you see, they've overturned a car and they're | | killing Armenians!" | | | +----------------------------------------------------------+ DEPOSITION OF ZAVEN ARMENAKOVICH BADASIAN Born 1942 Employed Sumgait Bulk Yarn Plant Resident at Building 34, Apartment 33 Microdistrict No. 12 Sumgait [Azerbaijan] On February 27 my wife and I went to Baku to go shopping and returned to Sumgait at around five in the evening. We ran into one of my relatives at the bus station and got to talking. A lot of people had gathered not far away, near the store. Well at first we didn't know what was happening, and then a fellow I know comes up to me, an Azerbaijani guy, and says, "What are you standing here for? Go home immediately!" I asked, "What's going on?" He says, "What's the matter, can't you see, they've overturned a car and they're killing Armenians!" He helped me catch a cab and we got home safely. We sat at home for two days. During that time a gang of bandits came into our courtyard. But the neighbors wouldn't let them in the building. There were about 80 of them. They had sticks and pieces of armatures in their hands. They were shouting something, but you couldn't understand it. It wasn't one voice or two, all of them were shouting in a chorus. They turned toward Building 35. They went up to the third _floor, and we see that they're breaking glass and throwing things out the window. After a while they come out the entryway: one has a pair of jeans in his hands, another has a tape recorder, and a third a guitar. They went on toward the auto parts store. We had to save ourselves. After midnight on March 1 we went to hide at School No. 33, which is in Microdistrict 13. There were two other Armenian families there with us. There were 13 of us altogether. Out of all of them I had only known Ernest before, he had moved to Sumgait from Kirovabad. The Azerbaijani guard at the school let us in. At first he didn't want to, but there was nowhere else for us to go. We had to plead with him and talk him into it. We were told that on that day, the 1st, there would be an attack on our microdistrict. We went upstairs to a classroom on the second floor. On the city radio station they announced three telephone numbers that could be used to summon assistance or communicate anything important. I called one of them and the First Secretary of the Sumgait City Party Committee answered. I asked him for assistance. I say, "We're in School No. 33, we need to be evacuated." Well he says, "Got it, wait there, I'm sending out help now." I know his voice. The First Secretary had been to our plant, I had spoken with him personally. When I called he said, "Muslimzade here." About two hours after the call we heard shouts near the school. We looked out the window and about 100 to 120 people were outside saying, "Armenians, come out, we're here to get you." They have clubs, axes, and armature shafts in their hands. The guard sat there with us, and asked, "Where should I go?" I say, "If your life is of any value to you you'll go down there and say that the Armenians were here and that they left." That's what he did. He went down there and said, "The Armenians were here," he said, "I let them out the back door, they went that way." And pointed with his hand. And with shouts and noise the mob set off in the direction he had pointed. So the assistance we had been promised did come. They sent us help, all right! Instead of sending real soldiers he had sent his own. I am positive that Muslimzade did that. No one had seen us entering the school, no one knew that we were there. In any case, we stayed at the school until seven in the morning, and no soldiers of any sort came to our aid. In the morning we went to my relative's in Microdistrict 1, and the soldiers took us to the SK club from there. The club was jammed with people, and there were lots of people ahead of us--there was no space available. One small boy, about three months old, died right in my arms. There wasn't a single doctor, nothing. The boy was uninjured, there were no wounds or bruises on him. He was just very ill. They gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, they did everything they could under the circumstances, but were unable to save him. And his mother and father, a young Armenian couple, were right there, on the floor ... I searched for a spot for us in the SK, we have a small child of our own, I wanted to find a room or something to put my family in. I went up to the third floor, there were a lot of soldiers up there, bandaged, with canes, limping, with their heads broken open. They were a terrible sight. Young guys, all of them. There were a lot of bandaged Armenians, too. Everyone had been beaten, everyone was crying, wailing, and calling for help. I think that the City Party Committee ignored us completely. True, there was a snack bar: a sausage was 30 kopeks or 40 kopeks, a package of cookies that cost 26 kopeks was being sold for 50, a bottled soft drink cost a ruble . . . But there was no way to get the things any cheaper. I met my old uncle, Aram Mikhailovich, there. He saw me and tears welled up in his eyes. My whole life he had told me that we were friendly peoples, that we worked together, he always had Azerbaijanis over at his house. And now he saw me and there was nothing he could say, he just cried. You can understand his feelings, of course.

BM] Think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent BM] countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe BM] the other out. These people will be neighbors, would it not be better BM] to keep the bad blood between them minimal? henrik] Don't get me WRONG. I also want PEACEFUL solution to the henrik] conflict. But until Azeris realize that, the Armenians in henrik] KARABAKH will defend themselves against aggresion. I don't know if you want a solution or just want to exchange slogans. Peace isn't what's happening right now, furthermore what's happening right now isn't condusive to peace. You can spend days and nights raving about how 'right' the Armenian position is and I'm sure there'll be others who'd be happy to talk to you by arguing the other side. If entrenched positions lead to war, and if people want peace than they should sit down and talk about a compromise. Armenia isn't strong enough to exercise the 'we think we're right, and we have the bombs, so we'll do whatever we want, so there...' style of foreign relations. Yes you can type Stalin in caps, and give one sided atrocity stories etc. but for peace you need to be willing to talk to the other side. You personally can choose not to do that of course, this being just USENET. The people in power shouldn't be so childish. BM] If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes BM] your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of BM] their blood and future. henrik] Again, you are taking different TURNS. Armenia HAS no intension henrik] to GRAB any LAND from Azerbaijan. The Armenians in KARABAKH henrik] are simply defending themselves UNTIL a solution is SET. Azeri's would disagree with you on this, and the maps I've seen support what they'd be saying. It doesn't seem likely that a solution will be reached in this manner. BM] It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize BM] craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled. The Armenians BM] in Armenia and N-K will be there, with the same people you seem to hate BM] as their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more. The sooner there's peace in BM] the region the better it is for them and everyone else. I'd push for BM] compromise if I were you instead of hitting the caps-lock and spreading BM] inflammatory half-truths. henrik] It is NOT up to me to decide the PEACE initiative. I am absolutely henrik] for it. It didn't look it when I read your posting. It would seem to me that if you can spew mis-information about a boogey-man, you can also talk about how one might avoid the nastiness. Fair? henrik] But, in the meantime, if you do not take care of yourself, henrik] you will be WIPED out. Such as the case in the era of 1915-20 of henrik] The Armenian Massacres. You don't realize I can say the same thing about 'The Turkish Massacres.' Yes, boys and girls, let's always talk about how bad and nasty things were. Let's do that so we're overwhelmed by anger, and let's do that so our kids will also be hateful. Sounds crazy doesn't it? Don't do it then. BM

DEPOSITION of VITALY NIKOLAYEVICH DANIELIAN [1] Born 1972 Attended 9th Grade Middle School No. 17 Resident at Building 4/2, Apartment 25 Microdistrict No. 3 Sumgait [Azerbaijan] Really, people in town didn't know what was happening on February 27. I came home from school at 12 o'clock, being excused to leave before the last period in order to go to Baku. When we left, everything in town was fine. Life was the same as usual, a few groups of people were discussing things, soccer and other things. Then we got on the Sumgait bus bound for Baku for my first cousin's birthday, my father, my mother, and I. We spent the day in Baku, and on the 28th, somewhere around 6:00 p.m., we got on the bus for home, figuring that I'd have enough time to do my homework for the next day. When we were entering town, near the 12-story high-rises, our bus was stopped by a very large crowd. The crowd demanded that the Armenians get off the bus. The driver says that there are no Armenians on board; then everyone on the bus begins to shout that there are no Armenians on board. The group comes up to the doors of the bus and has people get out one by one, not checking passports, just going by the way people look. We get off the bus, but are not taken for Armenians. We set out in the direction of home. At first we were going to go into an old building where we knew there'd be a place to hide, but the whole road was packed with groups of people, all the way from Block 41 to the 8th Microdistrict. These groups were emptying people's pockets and checking passports. People who didn't have passports with them were beaten as well. Then we decided to go home instead. Near the 12-story high-rises I saw burning cars and a great many people standing around the driveways, yelling. "Death to the Armenians" was written on the cars. When we came into the courtyard--we live in an L-shaped building--it was still quiet. We went on upstairs, but didn't turn on any lights. We tried to call Baku to warn our relatives, who were due to arrive on Wednesday, not to come. Then there was a knock at the door. It was our neighbors, who advised us to come down to stay at their place. We went down to their place, and they led us to the basement. They live on the first floor and have a basement which you enter across the balcony. We sat in the basement while an Armenian woman was beaten--she ran away naked. Our neighbors' daughter said that that's right, that's what the Armenians deserve, because in Stepanakert, allegedly, people were being killed, 11 girls from Agdam had been raped. We didn't stay very long in the basement. We tried to support one another as best we could, looking out the small window with the iron grating. Papa watched and said things now and then. He said that there was a fire near Building 5, probably a car on fire. Then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded that they be shown the apartments where Armenians lived. The neighbors said that there weren't any Armenians here, and the group set out for the other wing of the building. They appeared from the 5/2 side of the building, where, I later found out, a woman had been murdered. The woman who ran away naked died. Yuri Avakian was killed, too. When the crowd left, the neighbors said that it was all over and we could go home. We went back up to our place and again didn't turn on the light. We started to gather up our things in order to leave Sumgait for a while. We tried to call a relative who lived in Sumgait, but there was no answer. We decided she had already left. We sat at home. The phone rang, and the caller asked to speak with my father. I called him to the phone. It was Jeykhun Mamedov, from my father's work brigade. He said he was disgusted by what was happening in our town. He asked for our address and promised to get a car and help us get out of the city. To be quite honest, Papa didn't want to give him our address, but my mother got on the phone and told him. Some 15 minutes after the call a crowd ran into our entryway. Bursting into the building, they broke down the door and came into the apartment . . . They came straight to our apartment, they knew exactly where the Armenians were. They came into our place. We tried to resist, but there was nothing we could do. One of them took my parents' passports and began to read them. He read the surname "Danielian," turned the page, read "Armenian," and that alone was enough to doom us. He said that we should be moved quickly out into the courtyard, where they would have done with us. Another, standing next to him, pushed some of the keys on the piano and said "your death has tolled." They had knives and steel truncheons. I had a knife in my hand. Unfortunately, I didn't use it. I just knew that if I didn't give up the knife things would be much worse. They struck my parents and said that I should put the knife on the piano. Then, one of them commanded that we be taken outside. One person was giving orders. When we were taken outdoors I went in the middle, and my mother was behind me. Someone started to push her so she'd walk faster; I let her go ahead of me, and fell in behind her. When he tried to push me, I hit him, and at that moment they began beating my parents; I realized that resistance was completely useless. We are taken out into the courtyard, and the neighbors are standing on their balconies to see what will happen next. The crowd surrounds us. At first they strike me, and I'm knocked out; when I come to, they beat me again . . . I lose consciousness often . . . I don't see or hear my parents, since I was the first one hit and was out cold. When I come to I try to pick them up; they are lying next to me. The crowd is gone, the only people around are watching from their balconies. That's it. I try to pick them up, but can't. My left arm is broken. I start toward the drive, wanting to tell the neighbors to call an ambulance. The bodies of my parents are still warm. We were attacked at around 9 o'clock. I regain consciousness at about 11 and try to make it up the stairs home . . . When I knock at the neighbors' door, they push me back and tell me to go away. I go up to the third floor, our neighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance; she sends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment. I often look out the window to see if the ambulance has arrived, but I can't see very far as a result of the blows, and it seems that my parents have already been taken away. Then I calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken away, and everything will be OK. But they were still there. Later, at 8 in the morning as I found out, the ambulance picked them up, but they were already dead. If they received attention on time, it is possible they would still be alive. Later, around 12 o'clock on the 29th, policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with some "assistants." They call an ambulance, and 20 minutes later it arrives, and I am taken to the Sumgait Emergency Hospital. There they stitch the wounds on my head and rebind my arm. At 3 o'clock I and the other Armenians who are in the hospital are sent by ambulance to Baku. In my ward at the Sumgait Hospital there were five people, all of them Armenians. The hospital was nearly overflowing with Armenians. The only Azerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events, before the 27th. Then I was in the Semashko Hospital in Baku. I was there 38 days. When I was released, on the 40th day, I found out that my parents were dead. At first they told me that they were in Moscow being treated, but later I found out that they were dead. My father's older brother told me. My father's name was Nikolai Artemovich Danielian. He was born in 1938. My mother, born in 1937, was Seda Osipovna Danielian. Papa worked at PMK-20, the leader of the roofing brigade; mamma was a compressor operator. They were also beaten on the head. The coroner's report stated that their heads were smashed open and bled profusely. At the confrontation I met Jeykhun Mamedov, who had called. As it turned out later, he had been the one who tipped the crowd off. He had called specifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact address and dispatch the group. He knew the phone number, but didn't know the address. Before the events I had never seen him, but had often spoken with him on the phone, when he would ask to speak with my father. I knew him by name. He denies that I was the one who answered the phone, saying that my father answered it. He denies that he called from a public phone, saying that he called from home, which also isn't true. I heard noise and the sounds of automobiles. As I later found out, earlier he had been convicted, but had never served any time--he had received a suspended sentence. He was about 20 years old. I don't know if he has since confessed or not. I am sure that he was the one who tipped the crowd off. One-hundred percent sure. My parents were from Karabagh. Father was from the village of Badar, and was two years old when his family moved to Baku, where his elder brothers were to go to school. He was a student at the Naval School, but never graduated. He went off to work on the virgin lands [one of the gigantic agricultural projects instituted under Khrushchev.] When he returned he lived in Baku, and later moved to Sumgait, helping with the town's construction. Mamma was from the village of Dagdagan, also from Karabagh. She worked in Sumgait, first in a bookstore, and later, on a construction site. My sister is older than I. She lives with her husband here in Karabagh. I always loved my parents. That was why I went on to 9th grade, because it was their dream that I would continue my studies. I finished 8th grade and wanted to enter the Baku Nautical School, and after that, the Military School. But later I changed my mind, or rather, my parents got me to recon- sider, saying that it would be better to finish the 10th grade and then join the Naval School. I was planning to be in the Navy almost my whole life long--since childhood I had dreamed of being a sailor. My father wanted it more than anything. He always recollected his youth, telling of the School, and he always said that he had made a big mistake in leaving it. Now I live in Karabagh and never plan to leave here. I will stay at the home of my grandfather, of my ancestors, till the end of my days. While in the hospital in Baku I learned the fates of many others who had suffered as well, like Ishkhan [Trdatov]. He managed to hold them off [at their residence in Microdistrict 3, Building 6/2, Apartment 6.] for a long time, lost his father [Gabriel], and by some miracle managed to survive. I also learned of Uncle Sasha, from Building 5/2, whose daughter was raped . . . Besides them, Valery--I forgot his last name--was in the hospital too, about a year younger than I, he went to School No. 14. He was riding with his parents in the car. People were throwing rocks at them, he was hit, and his parents brought him to the hospital, and he was in our ward. We even came to be friends. Before that we had just seen each other around town. But in the hospital we got to know one another better. I learned of the fates of others, those who had died, or who were befallen by misfortune . . . Today Suren Harutunian, the First Secretary of the Communist party of Armenia, was shown on television. To be honest I am glad that Armenia agreed to recognize Nagorno Karabagh as part of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. I was repelled, no, revolted, to hear the Baku announcer who read the decision of the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Presidium against Karabagh becoming part of Armenia. After the events in Sumgait and those in Baku, the best solution is to give Karabagh to Armenia, return it to Armenia, since the people want to live peacefully with the Azerbaijanis, but everything has to be right before they can do that. I arrived in Karabagh on April 11. I felt very bad. I had constant headaches. After a while my strength returned. My older sister, Suzanna, took me in. I think that justice should prevail; the people are demanding their due. You can't take away what is their due. My parents and I often spoke of Nagorno Karabagh, often visited here--spent almost all of my vacations here. We had even decided that if Karabagh would be made part of Armenia, we would move here for sure. We always said that the Armenian people had suffered much, and that what had been done in 1921--removing Nagorno Karabagh from Armenia--was wrong. Sooner or later, mistakes should be corrected. And in order to correct a mistake, it must not be repeated; and the fate of all Nagorno Karabagh lies in the hands of our government.

I was opposed to intervention in Somalia for the same reason I am opposed to intervention in Bosnia - there is no security interest of the United States there which justifies risking the lives of American servicemen, and there are too many crises in the world for us to take on all of them. In the case of Bosnia, the risks are obviously much greater, and there are other countries in a much better position and with far better reasons to take action than the US. >The whole point is that Somalia _is_ a third world country, and we were more >willing to send troops there than to Bosnia--exactly the _opposite_ of what >the "fixation on European countries" theory would predict. (Similarly, the >desire to help Muslims being fought by Christians is also exactly the opposite >of what that theory predicts.) You continue to misunderstand. I did not say the reason why people want to intervene is because of racist (<- you seem to be overly fond of using this word, btw. I said the phenomenon was race-related, which is not the same as racist. Perhaps this distinction is too subtle for you to grasp) motives - I said the attention and outrage at the entire Yugoslavian situation was a result of it being 1) closer to home, 2) happening to people we can identify with, and 3) relentlessly harped on by the media. I never said anything about which side would be preferred, which has a lot more to do with the presentation of the conflict than any psychological factors. I think there is no doubt that despite the fact we intervened in Somalia, the level of attention devoted to there was considerably less than what is devoted to Bosnia, if the newspapers and tv news I see are any guide.

Source: 'The Times,' 3 March 1992 MASSACRE UNCOVERED.... By ANATOL LIEVEN, More than sixty bodies, including those of women and children, have been spotted on hillsides in Nagorno-Karabakh, confirming claims that Armenian troops massacred Azeri refugees. Hundreds are missing. Scattered amid the withered grass and bushes along a small valley and across the hillside beyond are the bodies of last Wednesday's massacre by Armenian forces of Azerbaijani refugees. From that hill can be seen both the Armenian-controlled town of Askeran and the outskirts of the Azerbaijani military headquarters of Agdam. Those who died very nearly made it to the safety of their own lines. We landed at this spot by helicopter yesterday afternoon as the last troops of the Commonwealth of Independent states began pulling out. They left unhindered by the warring factions as General Boris Gromov, who oversaw the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, flew to Stepanakert to ease their departure. A local truce was enforced to allow the Azerbaijaines to collect their dead and any refugees still hiding in the hills and forest. All the same, two attack helicopters circled continuously the nearby Armenian positions. In all, 31 bodies could be counted at the scene. At least another 31 have been taken into Agdam over the past five days. These figures do not include civilians reported killed when the Armenians stormed the Azerbaijani town of Khodjaly on Tuesday night. The figures also do not include other as yet undiscovered bodies Zahid Jabarov, a survivor of the massacre, said he saw up to 200 people shot down at the point we visited, and refugees who came by different routes have also told of being shot at repeatedly and of leaving a trail of bodies along their path. Around the bodies we saw were scattered possessions, clothing and personnel documents. The bodies themselves have been preserved by the bitter cold which killed others as they hid in the hills and forest after the massacre. All are the bodies of ordinary people, dressed in the poor, ugly clothing of workers. Of the 31 we saw, only one policeman and two apparent national volunteers were wearing uniform. All the rest were civilians, including eight women and three small children. TWO GROUPS, APPARENTLY FAMILIES, HAD FALLEN TOGETHER, THE CHILDREN CRADLED IN THE WOMEN'S ARMS. SEVERAL OF THEM, INCLUDING ONE SMALL GIRL, HAD TERRIBLE HEAD INJURIES: ONLY HER FACE WAS LEFT. SURVIVORS HAVE TOLD HOW THEY SAW ARMENIANS SHOOTING THEM POINT BLANK AS THEY LAY ON THE GROUND.

It is called "Memory of the camps" and shows some "un-censored" pictures taken immediately after the liberation of Bergen-Belsen and other death camps. I recommend it to everybody.

April 24th is approaching, and Armenians around the world are getting ready to remember the massacres of their family members by the Turkish government between 1915 and 1920. At least 1.5 Million Armenians perished during that period, and it is important to note that those who deny that this event ever took place, either supported the policy of 1915 to exterminate the Armenians, or, as we have painfully witnessed in Azerbaijan, would like to see it happen again...

Syrian occupation has been hostile, and amounts to annexation. Israel's is clearly defensive. If it were not defensive, you would see all of Lebanon occupied, and governed by Israel.

I agree that Arab news sources are also inherently biased. But I believe the statement I was reacting to was that since the american accounts of events are not fully like the Israeli accounts, the Americans are biased. I just thought that the Israelis had more motivation for bias. The UN has tried many times to condemn Israel for its gross violation of human rights. However the US has vetoed most such attempts. It is interesting to note that the U.S. is often the only country opposing such condemnation (well the U.S. and Israel). It is also interesting to note that that means other western countries realize these human rights violations. So maybe there are human rights violations going on after all.

Did you know that the word 'Karabag' itself is a 'Turkish' name? Before 1827, before the Russians and their 'zavalli kole' Armenians, drove all the Turks/Muslims out, it was a Turkish majority town. Well, anyway, it is not surprising that Armenians also collaborated with the Nazis. "Wholly opportunistic the Dashnaktzoutun have been variously pro-Nazi, pro-Russia, pro-Soviet Armenia, pro-Arab, pro-Jewish, as well as anti-Jewish, anti-Zionist, anti-Communist, and anti-Soviet - whichever was expedient."[1] [1] John Roy Carlson (Arthur Derounian), 'Cairo to Damascus,' Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1951, p. 438. As a dear friend put it, the Tzeghagrons (Armenian Racial Patriots) was the youth organization of the Dashnaktzoutun. It was based in Boston (where ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle is located) but had followers in Armenian colonies all over the world. Literally Tzeghagron means 'to make a religion of one's race.' The architect of the Armenian Racial Patriots was Garegin Nezhdeh, a Nazi Armenian who became a key leader of collaboration with Hitler in World War II. In 1933, he had been invited to the United States by the Central Committee of the Dashnaktzoutun to inspire and organize the American-Armenian youth. Nezhdeh succeeded in unifying many local Armenian youth groups in the Tzeghagrons. Starting with 20 chapters in the initial year, the Tzeghagrons grew to 60 chapters and became the largest and most powerful Nazi Armenian organization. Nezhdeh also provided the Tzeghagrons with a philosophy: "The Racial Religious beliefs in his racial blood as a deity. Race above everything and before everything. Race comes first."[1] [1] Quoted in John Roy Carlson (real name Arthur Derounian), "The Armenian Displaced Persons," in 'Armenian Affairs,' Winter, 1949-50, p. 19, footnote. Now wait, there is more. THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians in the town of Hojali is at last emerging in Azerbaijan - about 600 men, women and children dead in the worst outrage of the four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh. The figure is drawn from Azeri investigators, Hojali officials and casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates. The 25 February attack on Hojali by Armenian forces was one of the last moves in their four-year campaign to take full control of Nagorny Karabakh, the subject of a new round of negotiations in Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and a massacre, but investigators say that most of the dead were civilians. The awful number of people killed was first suppressed by the fearful former Communist government in Baku. Later it was blurred by Armenian denials and grief-stricken Azerbaijan's wild and contradictory allegations of up to 2,000 dead. The State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov, the cheif investigator of a 15-man team looking into what Azerbaijan calls the "Hojali Disaster", said his figure of 600 people dead was a minimum on preliminary findings. A similar estimate was given by Elman Memmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An even higher one was printed in the Baku newspaper Ordu in May - 479 dead people named and more than 200 bodies reported unidentified. This figure of nearly 700 dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman of the Azeri Ministry of Defence. FranCois Zen Ruffinen, head of delegation of the International Red Cross in Baku, said the Muslim imam of the nearby city of Agdam had reported a figure of 580 bodies received at his mosque from Hojali, most of them civilians. "We did not count the bodies. But the figure seems reasonable. It is no fantasy," Mr Zen Ruffinen said. "We have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead." Mr Rasulov endeavours to give an unemotional estimate of the number of dead in the massacre. "Don't get worked up. It will take several months to get a final figure," the 43-year-old lawyer said at his small office. Mr Rasulov knows about these things. It took him two years to reach a firm conclusion that 131 people were killed and 714 wounded when Soviet troops and tanks crushed a nationalist uprising in Baku in January 1990. Those nationalists, the Popular Front, finally came to power three weeks ago and are applying pressure to find out exactly what happened when Hojali, an Azeri town which lies about 70 miles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians. Officially, 184 people have so far been certified as dead, being the number of people that could be medically examined by the republic's forensic department. "This is just a small percentage of the dead," said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic scientist. "They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the chaos and the fact that we are Muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within 24 hours." Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14 years old. Gunshots killed 151 people, shrapnel killed 20 and axes or blunt instruments killed 10. Exposure in the highland snows killed the last three. Thirty-three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation, including ears, noses, breasts or penises cut off and eyes gouged out, according to Professor Youssifov's report. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said. Files from Mr Rasulov's investigative commission are still disorganised - lists of 44 Azeri militiamen are dead here, six policemen there, and in handwriting of a mosque attendant, the names of 111 corpses brought to be washed in just one day. The most heartbreaking account from 850 witnesses interviewed so far comes from Towfiq Manafov, an Azeri investigator who took a helicopter flight over the escape route from Hojali on 27 February. "There were too many bodies of dead and wounded on the ground to count properly: 470-500 in Hojali, 650-700 people by the stream and the road and 85-100 visible around Nakhchivanik village," Mr Manafov wrote in a statement countersigned by the helicopter pilot. "People waved up to us for help. We saw three dead children and one two-year-old alive by one dead woman. The live one was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but Armenians started a barrage against our helicopter and we had to return." There has been no consolidation of the lists and figures in circulation because of the political upheavals of the last few months and the fact that nobody knows exactly who was in Hojali at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by Armenian forces.

Greater Armenia would stretch from Karabakh, to the Black Sea, to the Mediterranean, so if you use the term "Greater Armenia" use it with care. [HE] With facist methods like [HE] killing, raping and bombing villages. The last move was the [HE] blast of a truck with 60 kurdish refugees, trying to [HE] escape the from Lacin, a city that was "given" to the Kurds [HE] by the Armenians. It has always been up to the Azeris to end their announced winning of Karabakh by removing the Armenians! When the president of Azerbaijan, Elchibey, came to power last year, he announced he would be be "swimming in Lake Sevan [in Armeniaxn] by July". Well, he was wrong! If Elchibey is going to shell the Armenians of Karabakh from Aghdam, his people will pay the price! If Elchibey is going to shell Karabakh from Fizuli his people will pay the price! If Elchibey thinks he can get away with bombing Armenia from the hills of Kelbajar, his people will pay the price. It also seems other non-Azeri minorities in Azerbaijan have understood they are next in line in this process of forced Azerification or deportation. Just look at the situation with the Lezgians. About the Kurds...what Kurds! According to the Azerbaijani government, there are no Kurds in Azerbaijan. Can't they make up their minds? Oh I see, there are only Kurds when the Azeris want them to be Kurds! And anyway, this "60 Kurd refugee" story, as have other stories, are simple fabrications sourced in Baku, modified in Ankara. Other examples of this are Armenia has no border with Iran, and the ridiculous story of the "intercepting" of Armenian military conversations as appeared in the New York Times supposedly translated by somebody unknown, from Armenian into Azeri Turkish, submitted by an unnamed "special correspondent" to the NY Times from Baku. Real accurate! [h] However, I hope that the Armenians WILL force a TURKISH airplane [h] to LAND for purposes of SEARCHING for ARMS similar to the one [h] that happened last SUMMER. Turkey searched an AMERICAN plane [h] (carrying humanitarian aid) bound to ARMENIA. [h] No, Henrik, these Turkish planes should be shot down with no questions asked. [HE] Don't speak about things you don't know: 8 American Cargo planes [HE] were heading to Armenia. When the Turkish authorities [HE] announced that they were going to search these cargo [HE] planes 3 of these planes returned to it's base in Germany. [HE] 5 of these planes were searched in Turkey. The content of [HE] of the other 3 planes? Not hard to guess, is it? It was sure not [HE] humanitarian aid..... Your "facts" in error. Shipments of all kinds that have transversed Turkey have been either searched, re-routed or confiscated. Some American planes were searched, others were re-routed, others were untouched. Rail shipments were held up last fall and last winter from entering Armenian from Turkey for the purpose of aiding in the economic collapse of Armenia. Wheat was confiscated, other shipments were exchanged with "crap" and dirt, then shipped to Armenia. U.S. planes don't have to use Turkish air bases. The U.S. uses these bases to bomb Iraq. Anyway, U.S. planes can fly over Georgia, which they have found is easier than to endure unnecessary expressions of Turkish chauvinism through searches of cargo which to this day have not revealed anything other than a paranoid Turkish military. [HE] Search Turkish planes? You don't know what you are talking about. [HE] since it's content is announced to be weapons? Well, big mouth Ozal said military weapons are being provided to Azerbaijan from Turkey, yet Demirel and others say no. No wonder you are so confused! [HE] Turkey's government has announced that it's giving weapons [HE] to Azerbadjan since Armenia started to attack Azerbadjan [HE] it self, not the Karabag province. So why search a plane for weapons [HE] since it's content is announced to be weapons? You are correct, all Turkish planes should be simply shot down!

When the Jewish National Fund bought most of its land, It didn't buy it from the Palestinians themselves, because, for the most part, they were tenant farmers (fallahin), living on land owned by wealthy Arabs in Syria and Lebanon. The JNF offered a premium deal, so the owners took advantage of it. It's called commerce.

The latest Israeli "proposal", first proposed in February of 1992, contains the following assumptions concerning the nature of any "interim status" refering to the WB and Gaza, the Palestinians, implemented by negotiations. It states that: >Israel will remain the existing source of authority until "final status" is agreed upon; >Israel will negiotiate the delegation of power to the organs of the Interim Self-Government Arrangements (ISGA); >The ISGA will apply to the "Palestinian inhabitants of the territories" under Israeli military administration. The arrangements will not have a territorial application, nor will they apply to the Israeli population of the territories or to the Palestinian inhabitants of Jerusalem; >Residual powers not delegated under the ISGA will be reserved by Israel; >Israelis will continue to live and settle in the territoriesd; >Israel alone will have responsibility for security in all its aspects- external, internal- and for the maintenance of public order; >The organs of the ISGA will be of an administrative-functional nature; >The exercise of powers under the ISGA will be subject to cooperation and coordination with Israel. >Israel will negotiate delegation of powers and responsibilities in the areas of administration, justice, personnel, agriculture, education, business, tourism, labor and social welfare, local police, local transportation and communications, municipal affairs and religious affairs. Several question do come to mind concerning the "success" we all hope for in the ongoing negotiation process. These arrangements certainly seem to be essentially a rejection of any Palestinian "interim" self-control. Without exposing itself to unwarranted risks and creating irresversible vulnerability, can Israel reasonably put forward (at later points in the negotiating process) more "relaxed" proposals for this"interim" period? How should proposals (from either side) be altered to temper their "maximalist" approaches as stated above? How can Israeli worries ,and desire for some "interim control", be addressed while providing for a very *real* interim Palestinian self-governing entity? Tim >Later comment: > >There seem to be two perceptions that **have to be addressed**. The >first is that of Israel, where there is little trust for Arab groups, so >there is little support for Israel giving up **tangible** assets in >exchange for pieces of paper, "expectations", "hopes", etc. The second >is that of the Arab world/Palestinians, where there is the demand that >these "tangible concessions" be made by Israel **without** it receiving >anything **tangible** back.

The suffering that they are Let us not forget about the genocide of the Azeri people in 'Karabag' and x-Soviet Armenia by the Armenians. Between 1914 and 1920, Armenians committed unheard-of crimes, resorted to all conceivable methods of despotism, organized massacres, poured petrol over babies and burned them, raped women and girls in front of their parents who were bound hand and foot, took girls from their mothers and fathers and appropriated personal property and real estate. And today, they put Azeris in the most unbearable conditions any other nation had ever known in history. AREF SADIKOV sat quietly in the shade of a cafe-bar on the Caspian Sea esplanade of Baku and showed a line of stitches in his trousers, torn by an Armenian bullet as he fled the town of Hojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope. "I'm still wearing the same clothes, I don't have any others," the 51-year-old carpenter said, beginning his account of the Hojali disaster. "I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to be alive." Mr Sadikov and his wife were short of food, without electricity for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12 days. They sensed the Armenian noose was tightening around the 2,000 to 3,000 people left in the straggling Azeri town on the edge of Karabakh. "At about 11pm a bombardment started such as we had never heard before, eight or nine kinds of weapons, artillery, heavy machine-guns, the lot," Mr Sadikov said. Soon neighbours were pouring down the street from the direction of the attack. Some huddled in shelters but others started fleeing the town, down a hill, through a stream and through the snow into a forest on the other side. To escape, the townspeople had to reach the Azeri town of Agdam about 15 miles away. They thought they were going to make it, until at about dawn they reached a bottleneck between the two Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak. "None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by a car on the road, and the Armenian outposts started opening fire," Mr Sadikov said. Azeri militiamen fighting their way out of Hojali rushed forward to force open a corridor for the civilians, but their efforts were mostly in vain. Mr Sadikov said only 10 people from his group of 80 made it through, including his wife and militiaman son. Seven of his immediate relations died, including his 67-year-old elder brother. "I only had time to reach down and cover his face with his hat," he said, pulling his own big flat Turkish cap over his eyes. "We have never got any of the bodies back." The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire. One hero of the evacuation, Alif Hajief, was shot dead as he struggled to change a magazine while covering the third group's crossing, Mr Sadikov said. Another hero, Elman Memmedov, the mayor of Hojali, said he and several others spent the whole day of 26 February in the bushy hillside, surrounded by dead bodies as they tried to keep three Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay. As the survivors staggered the last mile into Agdam, there was little comfort in a town from which most of the population was soon to flee. "The night after we reached the town there was a big Armenian rocket attack. Some people just kept going," Mr Sadikov said. "I had to get to the hospital for treatment. I was in a bad way. They even found a bullet in my sock." Victims of war: An Azeri woman mourns her son, killed in the Hojali massacre in February (left).

Now, I do not condone myself bombing villages, any kind of villages. But you claim these are villages with civilians, and Iraelis claim they are camps filled with terrorists. You claim that israelis shell the villages with the 'hope' of finding a terrorist or so. If they kill one, fine, if not, too bad, civilians die, right ? I am not so sure. As somebody wrote, Saddam Hussein had no problems using civilians in disgusting manner. And he also claimed 'civilians murdered'. Let me ask you, isn't there at least a slight chance that you (not only, and the question is very general, no insult) are doing a similar type of propaganda in respect to civilians in southern Lebanon ? Now, a lot people who post here consider 'Israeli soil' kind of Mediteranean sea. How do you define Israeli soil ? From what you say, if you do not clearly recognize the state of Israel, you condone killing israelis anywhere. >Dorin, are you aware that the IDF sent helicopters and gun-boats up the >coast of Lebanon the other day and rocketted a Palestinian refugee north of >Beirut. Perhaps I should ask YOU "what qualifies a person for murder?": I do not know what was the pupose of the action you describe. If it was to kill civilians (I doubt), I certainly DO NOT CONDONE IT.

If you ask me those questions, I will have no problem answering (not with a question, as you did) : No, NOBODY is qualified candidate for murder, nothing justifies murder. I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make similar statements, maybe after eliminating all Israelis, jews, ? Am I wrong ? Now tell me, did you also condone Saddam's scuds on israeli 'soldiers' in, let's say, Tel Aviv ? From what I understand, a lot of palestineans cheered. What does it show? It does not qualify for freedom fighting to me ? But again, I may be wrong, and the jewish controlled media distorted the information, and I am just an ignorant victim of the media, like most of us.

Like it or not, Edward, Anwar has a very good, valid point. Obviously, in presenting it, he (quite legitimately and deliberately) takes a point of view to an extreme which might not have been what you intended, but that is one of the best ways to demonstrate a "slippery slope" type of argument, which I believe was his aim. I very frankly believe that the ADL will be proved innocent in this case. I doubt there's enough evidence to weigh against them even in a civil court, where preponderance of the evidence, not evidence beyond any reasonable doubt, is the standard for "winning" such a case. That, however, does not prevent me from seeing the merit in Anwar's point.

Then you must be living in an alternate universe. Where were they? An Appeal to Mankind During the last three years Azerbaijan and its multinational population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of the Soviet Union. All humanitarian, constitutional human rights guaranteed by the UN Charter, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Helsinki Agreements, Human Problems International Forums, documents signed by the Soviet Union - all of them are violated. The USSR's President, government bodies do not defend Azerbaijan though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to guarantee life and peace. The 140,000 strong army of Armenian terrorists with Moscow's tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against Azerbaijan. As a result, a part of Azerbaijan has been occupied and annexed, hundreds of people killed, thousands wounded. Some 200,000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly deported from the Armenian SSR, their historical homeland. Together with them 64,000 Russians and 22,000 Kurds have also been driven out, a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan. Some 40,000 Turkish-Meskhetians, Lezghins and representatives of other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the Central Asia where the President and government bodies did not guarantee them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations. One of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against Azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the Armenian extremists' destruction of the Karabakh scientific experimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR. We beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance, for the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis are violated, its territory, culture and history are trampled, its people are shot. There is persistent negative image of Azerbaijanians abroad, and this defamation is spread over the whole world by Soviet mass media, Armenian lobby in the USSR and the United States. One of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance while the truth is that all these shootings and recent events stem from the territorial claims of Armenia on Azerbaijan. It is a well documented fact that before the conflict there were no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on the issue of Karabakh. Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly and calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land, had their representatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan SSR. We are for a united, indivisible, sovereign Azerbaijan, we are for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one of the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade. But all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the Soviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists encouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '1,000 Year Reich' - the 'Great Armenia' - by annexing the neighboring lands. The world public opinion shed tears to save the whales, suffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent. But what about the lives of seven million human beings? If these people are Muslims, does it mean that they are less valuable? Can people be discriminated by their colour of skin or religion, by their residence or other attributes? All people are brothers, and we appeal to our brothers for help and understanding. This is not the first appeal of Azerbaijan to the world public opinion. Our previous appeals were unheard. However, we still carry the hope that the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propaganda will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and stimulate at least as much help and compassion for Azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins.

When did the press report > it to the world? But perhaps Turkiye should intervene in the affairs of the Caucasus in the name of peace and democracy. The Armenians are Christians, the Azerbaijanis are Moslems, and Islam is a religion especially unloved by the democrat-westernizers. Besides, at the root of this conflict lie the territorial claims on Azerbaijan, a consequence of which were the blood and suffering of innocent Azeri people, hundreds of thousands of refugees, and gross violations of human rights. Recently Armenians attacked the Azeri town of Khojaly and massacred thousands of Azeris. The Paris-based 'Association for Democracy and Human Rights in Azerbaijan' puts the number of Khojali victims at 3,145. Some of the dead were scalped and mutilated. This whole thing has now gone entirely too far. > Want to know what will bring the story in Armenia to the front > page?

They already did. The scenario and genocide staged by the Armenians 78 years ago in the Ottoman Empire is being reenacted again - this time in Azerbaijan. There are remarkable similarities between the plots, the perpetrators, and the underdogs. Report taken from The New York Times, Tuesday, March 3, 1992 MASSACRE BY ARMENIANS BEING REPORTED Agdam,Azerbaijan,March 2 (Reuters) - Fresh evidence emerged today of a massacre of civilians by Armenian militants in Nagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly Armenian enclave of Azerbaijan. The republic of Armenia reiterated denials that its militants had killed 1,000 people in the Azerbaijani populated town of Khojaly last week and massacred men, women and children fleeing the carnage across snow-covered mountain passes. But dozen of bodies scattered over the area lent credence to Azerbaijani reports of a massacre. Scalping Reported Azerbaijani officials and journalists who flew briefly to the region by helicopter brought back three dead children with the back of their heads blown off. They said shooting by Armenians has prevented them from retrieving more bodies. "Women and children have been scalped," said Assad Faradshev, an aide to Nagorno-Karabakh's Azerbaijani Governor. "When we began to pick up bodies, they began firing at us." The Azerbaijani militia chief in Agdam, Rashid Mamedov, said: "The bodies are lying there like flocks of sheep. Even the fascists did nothing like this." Truckloads of Bodies Near Agdam on the outskirts of Nagorno-Karabakh, a Reuters photographer, Frederique Lengaigne, said she had seen two trucks filled with Azerbaijani bodies. "In the first one I counted 35, and it looked as though there were as many in the second," she said. "Some had their head cut off, and many had been burned. They were all men, and a few had been wearing khaki uniforms.

Israelis top leaders in the past and present, always come across as arrogant with their tough talks trying to intimidate the Arabs. The way I see it, Israelis and Arabs have not been able to achieve peace after almost 50 years of fighting because of the following two major reasons: 1) Arab governments are not really representative of their people, currently most of their leaders are stupid, and/or not independent, and/or dictators. 2) Israeli government is arrogant and none comprising.

The Orders for the Turkish Extermination of the Armenians #17 To the children of genocide: "Send them away into the Desert" This is part of a continuing series of articles containing official Turkish wartime (WW1) governmental telegrams, in translation, entailing the orders for the extermination of the Armenian people in Turkey. Generally, these telegrams were issued by the Turkish Minister of the Interior, Talaat Pasha, for example, we have the following set regarding children: "To the Government of Aleppo. November 5, 1915. We are informed that the little ones belonging to the Armenians from Sivas, Mamuret-ul-Aziz, Diarbekir and Erzeroum [hundreds of km distance from Aleppo] are adopted by certain Moslem families and received as servants when they are left alone through the death of their parents. We inform you that you are to collect all such children in your province and send them to the places of deportation, and also to give the necessary orders regarding this to the people. Minister of the Interior, Talaat" [1] "To the Government of Aleppo. September 21, 1915. There is no need for an orphanage. It is not the time to give way to sentiment and feed the orphans, prolonging their lives. Send them away to the desert and inform us. Minister of the Interior, Talaat" [2] "To the General Committee for settling and deportees. November 26, 1915. There were more than four hundred children in the orphanage. They will be added to the caravans and sent to their places of exile. Abdullahad Nuri. [3] "To the Government of Aleppo. January 15, 1916. We hear that certain orphanages which have been opened receive also the children of the Armenians. Whether this is done through the ignorance of our real purpose, or through contempt of it, the Government will regard the feeding of such children or any attempt to prolong their lives as an act entirely opposed to it purpose, since it considers the survival of these children as detrimental. I recommend that such children shall not be received into the orphanages, and no attempts are to be made to establish special orphanages for them. Minister of the Interior, Talaat." [4] "To the Government of Aleppo. Collect and keep only those orphans who cannot remember the tortures to which their parents have been subjected. Send the rest away with the caravans. Minister of the Interior, Talaat" [5] "From the Ministry of the Interior to the Government of Aleppo. At a time when there are thousands of Moslem refugees and the widows of Shekid [fallen soldiers] are in need of food and protection, it is not expedient to incur extra expenses by feeding the children left by Armenians, who will serve no purpose except that of giving trouble in the future. It is necessary that these children should be turned out of your vilayet and sent with the caravans to the place of deportation. Those that have been kept till now are also to be sent away, in compliance with our previous orders, to Sivas. Minister of the Interior, Talaat" [6] In 1926, Halide Edip (a pioneer Turkish nationalist) wrote in her memoirs about a conversation with Talaat Pasha, verifying and "rationalizing" this ultra-national fascist anti-Armenian mentality, the following: "I have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for its own interest, and succeeds, the world admires it and thinks it moral. I am ready to die for what I have done, and I know I shall die for it." [7] These telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the 1923 trial of Talaat Pasha's, assassin, Soghomon Tehlerian. The Turkish government never questioned these "death march orders" until 1986, during a time when the world was again reminded of the genocide of the Armenians. For reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial, the Turkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were ever issued, and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a study by S. Orel and S. Yuca of the Turkish Historical Society. If one were to examine the sample "authentic text" provided in the Turkish Historical Society study and use their same forgery test on that sample, it too would be a forgery!. In fact, if any of the tests delineated by the Turkish Historical Society are performed an any piece of Ottoman Turkish or Persian/Arabic script, one finds that anything handwritten in such language is a forgery. Today, the body of Talaat Pasha lies in a tomb on Liberty Hill, Istanbul, Turkey, just next to the Yildiz University campus. The body of this genocide architect was returned to Turkey from Germany during WW2 when Turkey was in a heightened state of proto-fascism. Recently, this monument has served as a focal point for anti-Armenianism in Turkey. This monument represents the epitome of the Turkish government's pathological denial of a clear historical event and is an insult to a people whose only crime was to be born Armenian. - - - references - - - [1] _The Memoirs of Naim Bey_, Aram Andonian, 1919, pages 59-60 [2] ibid, page 60 [3] ibid, page 60 [4] ibid, page 61 [5] ibid, page 61 [6] ibid, page 62 [7] _Memoirs of Halide Edip_, Halide Edip, The Century Press, New York (and London), 1926, page 387 -- David Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org | "How do we explain Turkish troops on S.D.P.A.

The Problem Book of Anania of Shirak ------------------------------------ "On the ancient peak of Ararat The centuries have come like seconds And passed on." -Avetik Issahakian by Yuri Danilov Some years ago Journalists interviewing celebrities liked to ask them: "What books would you take with you if you were to go off on a space flight?" And though the number of books allowed on the trip varied from 10 to 30, depending on the type of spacecraft and the generosity of the interviewer, and celebrities are people of the most varied tastes, ages, and professions, not one of them dared to say that he or she would want to take with them at least one book of arithmetic problems. Some of these people certainly excluded this kind of literature because they were trained in the humanities and had nothing but scorn for "numbers" (though secretly afraid of them). Others steered clear of such puzzle books because they were masters of incomparably more difficult branches of modern mathematics and didn't mind saying for all the world to hear that they didn't know how to solve mere arithmetic problems. Professional mathematicians were no exception. Here's what the Russian mathematician Alexander Khinchin, a specialist in statistics, wrote about arithmetic: "I willingly confess that any time a fifth-grader asked me to help solve an arithmetic problem, it was a hard work for me, and sometimes I failed completely. Of course, like most of my friends, I could easily solve the problem by the natural algebraic route --constructing equations or sets of equations. But we were supposed to avoid using algebraic analysis at all costs! . . . By the way, it's a fact that is well known and oft repeated that, as a rule, neither high school graduates, nor students at teaching colleges, nor teachers beginning their careers (nor, I must add, scientific researchers) can solve arithmetic problems. It seems the only people in the world who are able to solve them are fifth-grade teachers." Now, I'm not insisting that a book of arithmetic problems be included in the bookbag of anyone flying into space. But a sense of justice induces me to recommend one particular problem book, one that will satisfy the most fastidious taste and supply food for thought sufficient not only for a relatively short flight to the Moon but for a extended space voyage--say, to Venus and back. One for the "road" They both took out the books they brought for the road. Kingsley glanced at the Royal Astronomer's book and saw a bright cover with a group of cutthroats shooting at each other with revolvers. "God knows what this kind of stuff leads to," thought Kingsley. The Royal Astronomer looked at Kingsley's book and saw the History of Herodotus. "Good Lord, next he'll be reading Thucydides," thought the Royal Astronomer. --Fred Hoyle, The Black Cloud The book I'm talking about isn't very big, but its 24 problems constitute 24 elegant miniatures from seventh-century Armenia. Naive and wise at the same time, rich in striking detail and the bright coloration of the period, these problems are reminiscent of the reliefs on the famous monument of Armenian architecture, the church on the island of Akhtamar in Lake Van (in what is now Turkey_. They are as inseparable from the image of Armenia as the elegant letters of the Armenian alphabet, invented by Mesrop Mashtots, or the songs of Komitas, or the paintings of Saryan. An edition of these incredibly beautiful problems has long been a bibliographic rarity. It was published under the title Problems and Solutions of Vardapet [1] Anania of Shirak, Armenian Mathematician of the Seventh Century (translated and published by I. A. Orbeli, Petrograd, 1918). The abundance of close observations and wide-ranging information about the way of life and customs of that remote epoch when Anania of Shirak lived and worked have actually rendered a disservice to his problem book. For many years the book was known only to researchers in the humanities--specialists in Armenian history who jealously guarded their treasure and wouldn't let just anyone see it. Even now, after research by K. P. Patkanov, the learned monk Father Kaloust, J.I. Orbeli, A. Abramyan, V. K. Chaloyan, and others has brought the works of Anania of Shirak to light in scholarly circles, the general reader remains ignorant of the very existence of this remarkable problem book. Vardapet Anania of Shirak Once fell in love with the art of calculation, I thought that no philosophical notion can be constructed without number, considering it the mother of all wisdom. --Anania of Shirak Among ancient Armenian thinkers, Vardapet Anania of Shirak stands out because of the breadth of his interests and the unique mathematical orientation of his work. Some of his works have been preserved. In addition to the Problems and Solutions, the following tracts have found a special place in the estimation of scholars: On Weights and Measures, Cosmography and Calendrical Theory, and Armenian Geography of the Seventh Century A.D. (the authorship of the last work was long attributed to another outstanding thinker of ancient Armenia, Movses of Khoren). In his autobiography, Anania of Shirak has this to say about himself: I, Anania of Shirak, having studied all the science of our Armenian land and having learned the Holy Scripture intimately, in the expression of the psalmist, "every day I illuminated the eyes of my mind." Feeling myself lacking in the art of calculation, I came to the conclusion that it is fruitless to study philosophy, the mother of all sciences, without number. I could find in Armenia neither a man versed in philosophy nor books that explained the sciences. I therefore went to Greece and met in Theodosiople a man named Iliazar who was well versed in ecclesiastical works. He told me that in Forth Armenia [2] there lived a famous mathematician, Christosatur. I went this person and spent six months with him. But soon I noticed that Christosatur was a master not of all science but only of certain fragmentary facts. I then went to Constantinople, where I met acquaintances who told me: "Why did you go so far, when much closer to us, in Trebizon, on the coast of Pontus [3] lives the Byzantine vardapet Tyukhik. He is full of wisdom, is known to kings, and knows Armenian literature." I asked them how they knew this. They answered: "We saw ourselves that many people traveled long distances to become pupils of so learned a man. Indeed the archdeacon of the patriarchate of Constantinople, Philagrus, traveled with us, bringing many young persons to become pupils of Tyukhik." When I heard this, I expressed my gratitude to God, who had quenched the thirst of His slave. I went to Tyukhik at the monastery of St. Eugene and explained why I had come. He received me graciously and said: "I praise Our Lord that He sent you to learn and to transplant science in the domain of St. Gregory; I am glad that all your country will learn from me. I myself lived in Armenia for many years as a youth. Ignorance reigned there." Vardapet Tyukhik loved me as a son and shared all his thoughts with me. The Lord bestowed upon me His blessing: I completely assimilated the science of number, and with such success that my fellow students at the king's court began to envy me. I spent eight years with Tyukhik and studied many books that had not been translated into our language. For the vardapet had an innumerable collection of books: secret and explicit, ecclesiastical and pagan, books on art, history, and medicine, books of chronologies. Why enumerate them by title? In a word, there is no book that Tyukhik did not have. And he had such a gift from the Holy Spirit for translating that when he sat down to translate something from the Greek into Armenian, he did not struggle as other translators did, and the translation read as if the work were written in that language originally. Tyukhik told me how he had achieved such vast erudition and how he had learned the Armenian language. "When I was young," he said, "I lived in Trebizon, at the court of the military chief Ioannus Patricus, and for a long time, up to the accession of Mauritius to the throne I served as a military man in Armenia and learned your language and literature. During one attack by Persian troops on the Greeks, I was wounded and escaped to Antioch. I lost all my possessions. Praying to the Lord to heal my wounds, I made a promise: "If You prolong my life, I shall dedicate it not to accumulating perishable treasures but to collecting treasures of knowledge." And the Lord heard my prayers. After I recovered I went to Jerusalem, and from there to Alexandria and Rome. Upon returning to Constantinople, I met a famous philosopher from Athens and studied with him for many years. After that I returned to my homeland and began to teach and instruct my people." After some years that philosopher died. Not finding a replacement for him, the king and his courtiers sent for Tyukhik and invited him to assume the teacher's position. Tyukhik, citing the promise he made to God not to move far from the city, turned down the offer. But because of his wide leaning, people came streaming from all countries to study with him. And I, the most insignificant of all Armenians, having learned from him this powerful science, desired by kings, brought it to our country, supported by no one, obligated only to my own industry, God's help, and the prayers of the Blessed Educator. And no one thanked me for my efforts. Problems and Solutions A half and one sixth and one nine-ninth of all the books were printed on verge'; one fifth and one two-hundred-eighty-fifth--on rag paper; one forty-fifth and one eight-hundred-fifty-fifth--on vellum, and forty-five inscribed copies--on Dutch paper. And so, find how many copies were printed in all. --Imitation of Anania of Shirak A Latin proverb says habent sua fata libelli ("books have their own fate"). The fate of Problems and Solutions by Anania of Shirak is quite amazing. The manuscripts of Anania's book were preserved only because, according to Armenian historians, "in ancient and medieval Armenia manuscripts were guarded from invaders, like weapons, and cherished, like one's own children." Biding their time, the manuscripts lay in the Matenadaran, a renowned depository of ancient manuscripts (now the Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts). And its hour finally arrived. In 1896 the learned monk Father Kaloust used two manuscripts to publish the problem book, supplementing it with an introduction and commentary. In 1918 the book was translated into Russian, edited, annotated, and typeset by Iosef Orbeli, a prominent scholar (and later a member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR). In the translator's words, the problems of Anania are "amusing, full of life, and simple." Orbeli goes on to say: "The subjects of the problems are generally taken from everyday life. The scene is predominantly his homeland Shirak and the surrounding countryside, and the dramatis personae, if they are named, are the local princes--the Kamsarakans, including Nersekh, who was a contemporary of Anania." Like other ancient authors, Anania of Shirak used only "aliquots" -- that is, fractions with a numerator of 1. When it is necessary to write fractions with numerators other than 1, one has to represent it as a sum of aliquots (see the epigraph above). Like any true work of art, the problems of Anania suffer terribly in the retelling. You have to read the originals (albeit in translation) in their full glory. So let's open Anania's problem book--a gift from across the ages. Problems 1 and 8 relate to the Armenian uprising against the Persians in A.D. 572. Problem 1 My father told me the following story. During the famous wars between the Armenians and the Persians, prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed extraordinary heroic deeds. Three times in a single month he attacked the Persian troops. The first time, he struck down half of the Persian army. The second time, pursuing the Persians, he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers. The third time, he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army. The Persians who were still alive, numbering two hundred eighty, fled to Nakhichevan. And so, from this remainder, find how many Persian soldiers there were before the massacre. Problem 8 During the famous Armenian uprising against the Persians, when Zaurak Kamsarakan killed Suren, one of the Armenian azats[4] sent an envoy to the Persian king to report the baleful news. The envoy covered fifty miles in a day. Fifteen days later, when he learned of this, Zaurak Kamsarakan sent riders in pursuit to bring the envoy back. The riders covered eighty miles in a day. And so, find how many days it took them to catch the envoy. Problem 18 mentions vessels made of varying amounts of metal. In the Russian translation, they are all called "dishes." But in the original Armenian, according to Orbeli's note, the dishes in the first and second instances are called mesur, and in the third instance scutel. Scutel is a common Armenian word, but mesur had not been encountered in Armenian literature before Anania's Problems and Solutions. Problem 18 There was a tray in my house. I melted it down and made other vessels from the metal. From one third I made a mesur; from one fourth, another mesur; from one fifth, two goblets; from one sixth, two scutels; and from two hundred ten drams, I made a bowl. And now, find the weight of the tray. Several of the problems reflect the richness of the Caucasian fauna in Anania's time -- for instance, problem 7. Problem 7 Once I was in Marmet, the capital of the Kamsarakans. Strolling along the bank of the river Akhuryan, I saw a school of fish and ordered that a net be cast. We caught a half and a quarter of the school, and all the fishes that slipped out of the net ended up in a creel. When I looked in the creel, I found forty-five fishes. And now, find how many fishes here were in all. The temptation is great to present all 24 problems. But I'll restrain myself and offer you just one more. Problem 20 provides some interesting information about the wild animals that inhabited Armenia at one time but now extinct for so long that there is no mention of them even in zoological reference books. The wild donkey, according to the generally accepted view, never roamed the Armenian lands. Yet Anania of Shirak offers evidence to the contrary . Problem 20 The hunting preserve of Nersekh Kamsarakan, ter[5] of Shirak and Asharunik, was at the base of the mountain called Artin. One night great herds of wild donkey entered the preserve. The hunters could not cope with the donkeys and, running to the village of Talin, told Nersekh about them. When he arrived with his brothers and azats and entered the preserve, they began killing the wild beasts. Half of the animals were caught in traps, one fourth were killed by arrows. The young, which constituted one twelfth of all the animals, were caught alive, and three hundred sixty wild donkeys were killed by spears. And so, find how many beasts there were at the start of this massacre. "Set in type by me, Iosef Orbeli" His biography could not be squeezed into the framework of a bibliography. -- K Uzbashyan, Academician Iosef Abgarovich Orbeli Anyone who is lucky enough to hold a copy (1/n of the small printing--n is the solution to the epigraph in the previous section) of the Russian translation of Anania of Shirak's Problems and Solutions, a thin book with yellowed pages, has probably noticed the variety of the fonts, the elegance of the borders, and the high quality of the design, printing, and binding. Such great attention to detail is characteristic of works that fulfill a requirement for a degree in bookmaking. And this problem book was indeed a kind of diploma attesting to the professional maturity of the man who created it. An advertisement at the end of the book reads: "This book was typeset in December 1917 at the printing offices of the Russian Academy of Sciences by me, Iosef Orbeli; the text was also proofread, laid out, and decorated with borders by me. Various circumstances prevented me from carrying this project to the end; the final pages of the book were typeset by M. Strolman." Typesetting was neither the first nor the only profession of the renowned orientalist Iosef Orbeli, who later became the director of the Hermitage Museum in Leningrad. He was also a cabinetmaker and a locksmith. Orbeli had already become acquainted with the famous academic printing house Typis Academiae, founded in 1728 and known all over the scientific world for its rich collection of fonts and its virtuoso typesetters. In preparing to publish the corpus of ancient inscriptions preserved on the walls of Armenian churches, Orbeli found it necessary to create a new font that would preserve the unique signs and ligatures. This complicated work was done by M. G. Strolman. (Unfortunately the entire set of letters was destroyed during the blockade of Leningrad in World War II.) When Orbeli came to the printing offices of the Academy of Sciences, times were hard. The only way to publish the newly translated Problems of Anania was for Orbeli to learn typesetting (he had always been attracted to the printer's craft). In 1922 Orbeli became the director of printing at the Academy of Sciences. Even after he retired, he remained a tireless champion of Russian academic typography. Back to Earth This book by definition does not exhaust all the most important works in this domain. The editor hopes that those who are guilty of this incompleteness will read these lines and, stung by shame, will work up, if not a collection like this, at least a monograph. --V. Bonch-Bruyevich introduction to the Russian translation of Solid-Body Symmetry by R. Knox and A. Gold Let's imagine a time when space flight is an everyday thing, and high schoolers will spend their breaks as astronauts-in training in the Perelman crater on the far side of the Moon. Maybe one of the space travelers will take this very copy of Quantum, and another, looking over her shoulder, will read this article and say to himself: "This Anania from Shirak seems like a pretty interesting guy. When I get home I'll try to find his problems." Good luck, my young friend! Anania is sure to entertain you. Perhaps by then there will be more than n copies of his timeless Problems and Solutions. And we can hope they will be as lovingly printed as the masterpieces created by Iosef Orbeli. [1] Vardapet (or vartabed) means teacher or learned man in Armenian. (The Armenian language suffers in English from a dual transliteration scheme. Thus, Mesrop is often rendered as "Mesrob", Komitas as "Gomidas," and so on). [2] Fourth Armenia was one of fifteen provinces into which, according to Armenian Geography in the Seventh Century A.D., so-called Great Armenia was divided. [3] "Pontus" (or "Pontus Euxinus") was an old name for the Black Sea. [4] "Azats" were members one of several strata of freemen in ancient Armenia.

I have just started reading the articles in this news group. There seems to be an attempt by some members to quiet other members with scare tactics.

You're not playing with a full deck, are you? Where would Turkey invade? Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun? Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes she had, however, is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring the parties to the negotiating table. That's hard to do when Armenians are attacking Azeri towns. Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's going to cause incessant skirmishes. Think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe the other out. These people will be neighbors, would it not be better to keep the bad blood between them minimal? If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of their blood and future. It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled. The Armenians in Armenia and N-K will be there, with the same people you seem to hate as their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more. The sooner there's peace in the region the better it is for them and everyone else. I'd push for compromise if I were you instead of hitting the caps-lock and spreading inflammatory half-truths. cheers, BM

"We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the scattered bones of the dead." Ohanus Appressian "Men Are Like That" p. 202. A genocide is a deliberate and organized massacre of people in an attempt to exterminate a race. This is the worst crime in history. It happened to the Turks in eastern Anatolia and the Armenian dictatorship. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were killed in the worst ways imaginable. It is sickening to think that the human race is capable of such actions, but there is no denying the fact that the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslims happened. People of Turkiye deeply sympathize with those whose relatives were killed in the Turkish genocide. I understand their anger that there are those who still deny that the Turkish genocide indeed took place, despite the fact that the genocide of 2.5 million Turks has been well documented over the past six decades. We cannot reverse the events of the past, but we can and we must strive to keep the memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the Atlantic, so as to help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people because of their religion or their race.

"I have it from absolute first-hand information that the Armenians in the Caucasus attacked Tartar (Turkish) villages that are utterly defenseless and bombarded these villages with artillery and they murder the inhabitants, pillage the village and often burn the village." > Lets get somethings straight. Why not? >1. Armenians are no angels, but they were subject to Turkish genocide. And the Germans were subject to Jewish Genocide? Are you for real? Tell me 'Halsall', were you high on "ASALA/SDPA/ARF" forgeries and fabrications when you wrote that? Where is your non-existent list of scholars. Here is mine: During the First World War and the ensuing years - 1914-1920, the Armenian Dictatorship through a premeditated and systematic genocide, tried to complete its centuries-old policy of annihilation against the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 2.5 million Muslims and deporting the rest from their 1,000 year homeland. The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people.

Now wait, there is more. Mark Alan Epstein, 'The Ottoman Jewish Communities and their Role in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries,' Klaus Schwarz Werlag, Freiburg (1980). page 19: <<During the fifteenth century, when the Ottomans were struggling to reestablish themselves in the Balkans, there was considerable turmoil among the Jewish communities in Central and Western Europe. Even if the difficulties of the darker centuries immediately preceding the fourteenth are minimized, it is easy to understand the attraction which Ottoman life, particularly when compared to life in Europe, held for the Jews. There is no way to tell how many Jews left Christendom for the realm of the rising Muslim Ottomans, but with each account of persecution in or expulsion from Christian countries it is recorded that some Jews fled to Ottoman territory. The regularity of these reports suggests that the Ottomans were considered reasonably tolerant protectors and that there was a regular trickle of Jewish families moving southward and eastward from Western and Central Europe. (...) It is evident that the effects of plague, late crusades, and the general intolerance and persecution of Jews in Christian Europe resulted in the redirection of the whole focus of Jewish life which, for more than two centuries, was to be oriented toward Muslim East.>> page 21: <<In the second quarter of the fifteenth century the foremost official in the Edirne Jewish community was Rabbi Yitzhak Sarfati the Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of the city. He was the most important rabbi in the city and the author of an important letter which tells us something of the situation of the Edirne Jewry in the fifteenth century. Sarfati himself was from Christian Europe and supposedly wrote this letter at the behest of two recent arrivals from there, who, upon seeing the prosperity and freedom of the Ottoman Jews, prevailed upon him to write their European coreligionists apprising them of the situation and urging them to migrate. This remarkable letter advised its recipients not only of the pleasant conditions in the Ottoman domains, but described as well the ease of travel to Palestine and the holy places, an attraction to those who would make a pilgrimage or choose to be buried there.>> (*) page 41: <<...the impression gained from the Hebrew sources is that the Jews were firmly aware of the community of interests which existed between them and the Ottomans, especially in comparison to relations with the Christians of Europe. Confirmation of the commonality of interests between Muslims and Jews is also indicated by the fact that European Christians perceived the Jews as allies of Islam and were well aware of Muslim-Jewish cooperation. Certainly the activity of important Jewish financiers and politicians representing the Ottoman government abroad did not pass unnoticed. European sources are the basis for much of our knowledge of their careers. In addition it appears that Christian pirates plundered ''Turks and Jews,'' their sworn enemies, and that Europeans considered the Jews to be agents who regularly reported to the Ottomans. There are well-known examples of overt Jewish support for the Ottomans in the struggle against European powers. The two best known instances of Jewish support for the campaigning Ottomans are the frequently cited instances of the Jewish contributions to the conquests of Buda, in the early sixteenth century, and of Rhodes. We also have reports of sympathy for the Ottomans during the siege of Chios. An unpublished Ottoman document shows dramatically the mutual interests which existed in some Greek towns...>> page 43: <<It is clear that throughout the sixteenth century it was a generally accepted fact that the interests of Jews and Muslims coincided frequently, and all parties involved, Jews, Muslims, and Christians, were aware of the situation.>> page 46: <<...it seems that the relations between Greeks and Jews were not particularly cordial. The two groups had little in common, few common interests, and perceived no common philosophical or religious tradition which could serve as the basis for cooperation, rather than enmity. If there was any identifiable bond of good will which existed between religious communities in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, it was that between Muslims and Jews, neither of whom had much in common with the Orthodox.>> page 46: <<The general impression of Muslim-Jewish relations in the Ottoman context during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is one of community of interests. From the earliest times the Ottomans seem to have welcomed Jews to their territory and to have found in the communities already existing in places which they conquered a cooperative element. The Jewish response to this tolerance was a steady flow of Jews from Christian countries to Ottoman domains.>> page 151: <<From the period before 1453 we have only a few indications that the Ottoman-Jewish relationship was well on the course of amity which would characterize it for years afterward, but the liberality of the Ottomans, in contrast to the intolerance of the Byzantines, and the protection and the security which the Ottomans offered, in comparison to conditions elsewhere, leave little doupt that even then both the Ottomans and the Jews recognized their mutual interests...>> page 161: <<It is impossible to say how fundamental the Jews were in the success of the Ottomans in rebuilding Istanbul or in Ottoman mercantile success in the sixteenth century. That they played an important role in both cannot be doupted. It is also unclear whether they were important enough to say that the Ottomans would not have experienced their great success without the Jews and that no other group could have been found to serve the Ottomans as well as did the Jews. It is, however, unmistakably clear that there are few parallels in world history to this remarkable partnership between Jews and the non-Jewish society in which they lived. We must conclude that the Ottomans could probably not achieved their success without a group performing certain tasks for them as well as the Jews did. Certainly for the Jews of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the Ottoman Empire was a most remarkable and salubrious home.>> (*) A version of Rabbi Sarfati's [Tzarfati] letter is given by Prof.Shaw: page 32: <<Your cries and sobs reached us. We have been told of all the troubles and persecutions which you have to suffer in the German lands....I hear the lamentation of my brethren...The barbarous and cruel nation ruthlessly oppresses the faithful children of the chosen people...The priests and prelates of Rome have risen. They wish to root out the memory of Jacob and erase the name of Israel. They always devise new persecutions. They wish to bring you to the stake...Listen my brethren, to the counsel I will give you. I too was born in Germany and studied Torah with the German rabbis. I was driven out of my native country and came to the Turkish land, which is blessed by God and filled with all good things. Here I found rest and happiness; Turkey can also become for you the land of peace...If you who live in Germany knew even a tenth of what God has blessed us with in this land, you would not consider any difficulties; you would set out to come to us...Here in the land of the Turks we have nothing to complain of. We possess great fortunes; much gold and silver in our hands. We are not oppressed with heavy taxes, and our commerce is free and unhindered. Rich are the fruits of the earth. Everything is cheap, and every one of us lives in peace and freedom. Here the Jew is not compelled to wear a yellow hat as a badge of shame, as is the case in Germany, where even wealth and great fortune are a curse for a Jew because he therewith arouses jealousy among the Christians and they devise all kinds of slander against him to rob him of his gold. Arise my brethren, gird up your loins, collect your forces, and come to us. Here you will be free of your enemies, here you will find rest...>>[13] [13] Israel Zinberg, A History Of Jewish Literature. vol.V.

At issue was not a trial behind closed doors, but arrest, trial and imprisonment in complete secrecy. This was appraently attempted in the case of Vanunu and failed. It has happened before, and there is reason to believe it still goes on. Read this: From Ma'ariv, February 18 (possibly 28), 1992 PUBLICATION BAN The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever being made public. By Baruch Me'iri All those involved in this matter politely refused my request, one way or another: "Look, the subject is too delicate. If I comment on it, I will be implicitly admitting that it is true; If I mention a specific case, even hint at it, I might be guilty of making public something which may legally not be published". The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever being made public. More precisely: A court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of their arrest, and later on their imprisonment. In Israel of 1993, citizens are imprisoned without us, the citizens of this country, knowing anything about it. Not knowing anything about the fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison, for security offenses, in complete secrecy. In the distant past -- for example during the days of the [Lavon - YA] affair -- we heard about "the third man" being in prison. But many years have passed since then, and what existed then can today no longer be found even in South American countries, or in the former Communist countries. But it appears that this is still possible in Israel of 1993. The Chair of the Knesset Committee on Law, the Constitution and Justice, MK David Zucker, sent a letter on this subject early this week to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, and the Cabinet Legal Advisor. Ma'ariv has obtained the content of the letter: "During the past several years a number of Israeli citizens have been imprisoned for various periods for security offenses. In some of these cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the specifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted, but even on the mere fact of their imprisonment. In those cases, after being legally convicted, the prisoners spend their term in prison without public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the prisoner", asserts MK Zucker. On the other hand Zucker agrees in his letter that, "There is absolutely no question that it is possible, and in some cases it is imperative, that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of security offenses and the course of trials. But even in such cases the Court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances under which a trial will not be held in public. "However, one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on the mere fact of a person's arrest, and on the name of a person sentenced to prison, is justified and appropriate in the State of Israel. The principle of public trial and the right of the public to know are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public sight and his descent into the abyss of prison." Zucker thus decided to turn to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice and the Cabinet Legal Advisor and request that they consider the question. "The State of Israel is strong enough to withstand the cost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment. The State of Israel cannot be allowed to have prisoners whose detention and its cause is kept secret", wrote Zucker. The legal counsel of the Civil Rights Union, Attorney Mordechai Shiffman said that, "We, as the Civil Rights Union, do not know of any cases of security prisoners, Citizens of Israel, who are imprisoned, and whose imprisonment cannot be made public. This is a situation which, if it actually exists, is definitely unhealthy. Just like censorship is an unhealthy matter". "The Union is aware", says Shiffman, "of cases where notification of a suspect's arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld. I am speaking only of several days. I know also of cases where a detainee was not allowed to meet with an attorney -- sometimes for the whole first month of arrest. That is done because of the great secrecy. "The suspect himself, his family, his lawyer -- or even a journalist -- can challenge the publication ban in court. But there are cases where the family members themselves are not interested in publicity. The journalist knows nothing of the arrest, and so almost everyone is happy..." Attorney Yossi Arnon, an official of the Bar, claims that given the laws as they exist in Israel today, a situation where the arrest of a person for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible. "Nothing is easier. The court orders a publication ban, and that's that. Someone who has committed security offenses can spend long years in prison without us knowing anything about it." -- Do you find this situation acceptable? Attorney Arnon: "Definitely not. We live in a democratic country, and such a state of affairs is impermissible. I am well aware that publication can be damaging -- from the standpoint of security -- but total non-publication, silence, is unacceptable. Consider the trial of Mordechai Vanunu: at least in his case we know that he was charged with aggravated espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison. The trial was held behind closed doors, nobody knew the details except for those who were authorized to. It is somehow possible to understand, though not to accept, the reasons, but, as I have noted, we at least are aware of his imprisonment." -- Why is the matter actually that serious? Can't we trust the discretion of the court? Attorney Arnon: "The judges have no choice but to trust the presentations made to them. The judges do not have the tools to investigate. This gives the government enormous power, power which they can misuse." -- And what if there really is a security issue? Attorney Arnon: "I am a man of the legal system, not a security expert. Democracy stands in opposition to security. I believe it is possible to publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges -- without entering into detail. We have already seen how the laws concerning publication bans can be misused, in the case of the Rachel Heller murder. A suspect in the murder was held for many months without the matter being made public." Attorney Shiffman, on the other hand, believes that state security can be a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspect's arrest, or of a convicted criminal's imprisonment. "A healthy situation? Definitely not. But I am aware of the fact that mere publication may be harmful to state security". A different opinion is expressed by attorney Uri Shtendal, former advisor for Arab affairs to Prime Ministers Levi Eshkol and Golda Meir. "Clearly, we are speaking of isolated special cases. Such situations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding must be held in public. No doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom of expression. Definitely also to the principle of individual freedom which is also harmed by the prohibition of publication. "Nevertheless", adds Shtendal, "the legislator allowed for the possibility of such a ban, to accommodate special cases where the damage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than that which may follow from an abridgment of the principles I've mentioned. The authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest with the Prime Minister or the security services, but with the court, which we may rest assured will authorize a publication ban only if it has been convinced of its need beyond a shadow of a doubt." Nevertheless, attorney Shtendal agrees: "As a rule, clearly such a phenomenon is undesirable. Such an extreme step must be taken only in the most extreme circumstances." -- Yigal Arens USC/ISI TV made me do it! arens@isi.edu
In article <christopherU3AK245pe@clarinet.com> clarinews@clarinet.com (SID BALMAN Jr.) writes: WASHINGTON (UPI) -- Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Tuesday there are better ideas to stop the human slaughter in the Balkans than ordering American fighters to bomb the Serbs, but a frustrated senator told him to do just that. ``We've not done a damn thing,'' Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., told Christopher at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ``Preventive diplomacy is not in your capability right now in Bosnia- Herzegovina. Biden chastised the administration and its Republican predecessor for what he characterized as a limp response to the Serbian policy of ``ethnic cleansing'' of Muslims, including rape and shelling of civilians. ``The time has come for us and the world to stop bemoaning the fact that all the options are bad ones,'' Biden said. ``They are all bad ones and we ought to pick a couple.'' Biden also endorsed lifting an international arms embargo against the former Yugoslavia so the Muslim-dominated Bosnian government might have a chance to at least defend itself against the Serbs. Christopher said this could give an opening role in the conflict to **************************************************** the radical Islamic government of Iran. *************************************** O, I C! Biden endorsed bombing Serbian heavy weapons around the besieged eastern town of Srebrenica. ``There's not a military person...who will not tell you that they could today, if you gave them the order, take out the heavy weaponry around Srebrenica,'' Biden said. ``If you did nothing else, nothing else but that, you would have saved hundreds of women and children who are being absolutely massacred right now.'' Military action ``is the only thing that's going to change the equation,'' Biden said. .................................... Despite the frustrations and pressure, Christopher had no enthusiasm for American combat aircraft to strike Serb positions in Bosnia- Herzegovina. .................... > ``Clearly we are at a turning point in the Bosnia situation,'' >Christopher said. ``Air strikes are among those steps that are so >complex because they tend to interfere with the humanitarian endeavours. >I think there may be better options.''

Now that they made sure the Bosnian (who were the only real subject of the embargo last year, as everybody knows that the Serbs had an unlimited supply of arms) wre massacred without having a chance to defend themselves, Now this evil coldhearted snake is saying "it is too late to save them, so let them die.

I realized that the dan- ger was past, and stopped controlling myself. I relaxed for a moment and the physical pain immediately made itself felt. My heart and kidneys hurt. I had an awful kidney attack. I rolled back and forth on top of those Christmas ornaments, howling and howling. I didn't know where I was or how long this went on. When we figured out the time, later it turned out that I howled and was in pain for around an hour. Then all my strength was gone and I burst into tears, I started feeling sorry for myself, and so on and so forth . . . Then someone came into the room. I think I hear someone calling my name. I want to respond and restrain myself, I think that I'm hallucinating. I am silent, and then it continues: it seems that first a man's voice is calling me, then a woman's. Later I found out that Mamma had sent our neighbor, the one whose apartment she was hiding in, Uncle Sabir Kasumov, to our place, telling him, "I know that they've killed Lyuda. Go there and at least bring her corpse to me so they don't violate her corpse." He went and returned empty handed, but Mamma thought he just didn't want to carry the corpse into his apartment. She sent him another time, and then sent his wife, and they were walking through the rooms looking for me, but I didn't answer their calls. There was no light, they had smashed the chandeliers and lamps. They started the pogrom in our apartment around five o'clock, and at 9:30 I went down to the Kasumovs'. I went down the stairs myself. I walked out of the apartment: how long can you wait for your own death, how long can you be cowardly, afraid? Come what will. I walked out and started knocking on the doors one after the next. No one, not on the fifth floor, not on the fourth, opened the door. On the third floor, on the landing of the stairway, Uncle Sabir's son started to shout, "Aunt Roza, don't cry, Lyuda's alive!" He knocked on his own door and out came Aunt Tanya, Igor, and after them, Mamma. Aunt Tanya, Uncle Sabir's wife, is an Urdmurt. All of us were in their apartment. I didn't see Karina, but she was in their home, too, Lying delirious, she had a fever. Marina was there too, and my father and mother. All of my family had gathered there. At the door I lost consciousness. Igor and Aunt Tanya carried me into the apartment. Later I found out what they had done to our Karina. Mamma said, "Lyuda, Karina's in really serious condition, she's probably dying. If she recognizes you, don't cry, don't tell her that her face looks so awful." It was as though her whole face was paralyzed, you know, everything was pushed over to one side, her eye was all swollen, and everything flowed together, her lips, her cheeks . . . It was as though they had dragged her right side around the whole microdistrict, that's how disfigured her face was. I said, "Fine." Mamma was afraid to go into the room, because she went in and hugged Karina and started to cry. I went in. As soon as I saw her my legs gave way. I fell down near the bed, hugged her legs and started kissing them and crying. She opened the eye that was intact, looked at me, and said, "Who is it?" But I could barely talk, my whole face was so badly beaten. I didn't say, but rather muttered something tender, something incomprehensible, but tender, "My Karochka, my Karina, my little golden one . . . " She understood me. Then Igor brought me some water, I drank it down and moistened Karina's lips. She started to groan. She was saying something to me, but I couldn't understand it. Then I made out, "It hurts, I hurt all over." Her hair was glued down with blood. I stroked her forehead, her head, she had grit on her forehead, and on her lips . . . She was groaning again, and I don't know how to help her. She calls me over with her hand, come closer. I go to her. She's saying something to me, but I can't understand her. Igor brings her a pencil and paper and says, "Write it down." She shakes her head as if to say, no, I can't write. I can't understand what she's saying. She wanted to tell me something, but she couldn't. I say, "Karina, just lie there a little while, then maybe you'll feel better and you can tell me then." And then she says, "Maybe it'll be too late." And I completely . . . just broke down, I couldn't control myself. Then I moistened my hand in the water and wiped her forehead and eye. I dipped a handkerchief into the water and squeezed a little water onto her lips. She says, "Lyuda, we're not saved yet, we have to go somewhere else. Out of this damned house. They want to kill us, I know. They'll find us here, too. We need to call Urshan." She repeated this to me for almost a whole hour, Until I understood her every word. I ask, "What's his number?" Urshan Feyruzovich, that's the head of the administration where she works. "We have to call him." But I didn't know his home number. I say, "Karina, what's his number?" She says, "I can't remember." I say, "Who knows his number? Who can I call?" She says, "I don't know anything, leave me alone." I went out of the room. Igor stayed to watch over her and sat there, he was crying, too. I say, "Mamma, Karina says that we have to call Urshan. How can we call him? Who knows his telephone number?" I tell Marina, "Think, think, who can we call to find out?" She started calling; several people didn't answer. She called a girlfriend, her girlfriend called another girlfriend and found out the number and called us back. The boss's wife answered and said he was at the dacha. My voice keeps cracking, I can't talk normally. She says, "Lyuda, don't panic, get a hold of yourself, go out to those hooligans and tell them that they just can't do that." She still didn't know what was really going on. I said, "It's easy for you to say that, you don't understand what's happening. They are killing people here. I don't think there is a single Armenian left in the building, they've cut them all up. I'm even surprised that we managed to save ourselves. "She says, "Well, OK, if it's that serious . . . " And all the same she's thinking that my emotions are all churned up and that I'm fearing for my life, that in fact it's not all that bad. "OK, fine, fine," she says, "if you're afraid, OK, as soon as Urshan comes back I'll send him over." We called again because they had just started robbing the apartment directly under Aunt Tanya's, on the second floor, Asya Dallakian's apartment. She wasn't home, she was staying with her daughter in Karabagh. They destroyed everything there . . . We realized that they still might come back. We kept on trying to get through to Aunt Tanya--Urshan's wife is named Tanya too and finally we get through. She says, "Yes, he's come home, he's leaving for your place now." He came. Of course he didn't know what was happening, either, because he brought two of his daughters with him. He came over in his jeep with his two daughters, like he was going on an outing. He came and saw what shape we were in and what was going on in town and got frightened. He has grown up daughters, they're almost my age. The three of us carried out Karina, tossed a coat on her and a warm scarf, and went down to his car. He took Karina and me to the Maternity Home. . . No, first they took us to the po]ice precinct. They had stretchers ready. As soon as we got out of the car they put Karina and me on stretchers and said that we were in serious condition and that we mustn't move, we might have fractures. From the stretcher I saw about 30 soldiers sitting and lying on the first floor, bandaged, on the concrete floor, groaning . . . This was around eleven o'clock at night. We had left the house somewhere around 1:30. When I saw those soldiers I realized that a war was going on: soldiers, enemies . . . everything just like a war. They carried me into some office on the stretcher. The emergency medical people from Baku were there. The medical attendant there was an older Armenian. Urshan told him what they had done to Karina because she's so proud she would never have told. And this aging Armenian . . . his name was Uncle Arkady, I think, because someone said "Arkady, get an injection ready," he started to fill a syringe, and turned around so as to give Karina a shot. But when he looked at her face he became ill. And he was an old man, in his sixties, his hair was all grey, and his moustache, too. He hugged Karina and started to cry: "What have they done to you?!" He was speaking Armenian. "What have they done to you?!" Karina didn't say anything. Mamma came in then, and she started to cry, too. The man tried to calm her. "I'll give you a shot." Mamma tells him, "I don't need any shot. Where is the government? Just what are they doing? Look what they've done to my children! They're killing people, and you're just sitting here!" Some teacups were standing on the table in there. "You're sitting here drinking tea! Look what they've done to my daughters! Look what they've turned them into!" They gave her something to drink, some heart medicine, I think. They gave Karina an injection and the doctor said that she had to be taken to the Maternity Home immediately. Papa and Urshan, I think, even though Papa was in bad shape, helped carry Karina out. When they put her on the stretcher, none of the medics got near her. I don't know, maybe there weren't any orderlies. Then they came to me: "What's the matter with you?" Their tone was so official that I wrapped myself tighter in the half-length coat. I had a blanket on, too, an orange one, Aunt Tanya's. I said, "I'm fine." Uncle Arkady came over and was soothing me, and then told the doctor, "You leave, let a woman examine her." A woman came, an Azerbaijani, I believe, and said, "What's wrong with you?" I was wearing my sister Lyuda's nightshirt, the sister who at this time was in Yerevan. When she was nursing her infant she had cut out a big hole in it so that it would be easier to breast feed the baby. I tore the night shirt some more and showed her. I took it off my shoulders and turned my back to her. There was a huge wound, about the size of a hand, on my back, from the Indian vase. She said something to them and they gave me two shots. She said that it should be dressed with something, but that they'd do that in the hospital. They put me on a stretcher, too. They started looking for people to carry me. I raised up my head a little and wanted to sit up, and this woman, I don't know if she was a doctor or a nurse, said, "Lie still, you mustn't move." When I was lying back down I saw two policemen leading a man. His profile seemed very familiar to me. I shouted, "Stop!" One of the policemen turned and says, "What do you want?" I say, "Bring him to me, I want to look at him." They brought him over and I said, "That person was just in our apartment and he just raped me and my sister. I recognize him, note it down." They said, "Fine," but didn't write it down and led him on. I don't know where they were taking him. Then they put my stretcher near where the injured and beaten soldiers were sitting. They went to look for the ambulance driver so he would bring the car up closer. One of the soldiers started talking to me, "Sister . . . " I don't remember the conversation exactly, but he asked me were we lived and what they did to us. I asked him, "Where are you from?" He said that he was from Ufa. Apparently they were the first that were brought in. The Ufa police. Later I learned that they suffered most of all. He says, "OK, you're Armenians, they didn't get along with you, but I'm a Russian," he says, "what are they trying to kill me for?" Oh, I remembered something else. When I went out onto the balcony with Kuliyev for a hammer and nails I looked out the window and saw two Azerbaijanis beating a soldier near the kindergarten. He was pressed against the fence and he covered his head with his arms, they were beating him with his own club. The way he cried "Mamma" made my skin crawl. I don't know what they did to him, if he's still alive or not. And something else. Before he attack on our house we saw sheets, clothes, and some dishes flying from the third or fourth floor of the neighboring building, but I didn't think it was Azerbaijanis attacking Armenians. I thought that something was on fire or they were throwing something they didn't need out, or someone was fighting with someone. It was only later, when they were burning a passenger car in the yard, when the neighbors said that they were doing that to the Armenians, that I realized that this was serious, that it was anti-Armenian. They took Karina and me to the Sumgait Maternity Home. Mamma went to them too and said, "I've been beaten too, help me." But they just ignored her. My father went to them and said in a guilty voice, as though it was his fault that he'd been beaten, and says, "My ribs hurt so much, those creeps have probably broken my ribs. Please look at them." The doctor says, "That's not my job." Urshan said, "Fine, I'll take you to my place and if we need a doctor, I'll find you one. I'll bring one and have him look at you. And he drove them to his apartment. Marina and I stayed there. They examined us. I was more struck by what the doctor said than by what those Azerbaijanis in our apartment did to us. I wasn't surprised when they beat us they wanted to beat us, but I was very surprised that in a Soviet medical facility a woman who had taken the Hippocratic Oath could talk to victims like that. By happy--or unhappy-- coincidence we were seen by the doctor that had delivered our Karina. And she, having examined Karina, said, "No problem, you got off pretty good. Not like they did in Kafan, when you Armenians were killing and raping our women. "Karina was in such terrible condition that she couldn't say anything--she would certainly have had something to say! Then they examined me. The same story. They put us in a separate ward. No shots, no medicinal powders, no drugs. Absolutely none! They didn't even give us tea. All the women there soon found out that in ward such and such were Armenians who had been raped. And they started coming and peering through the keyhole, the way people look at zoo animals. Karina didn't see this, she was lying there, and I kept her from seeing it. They put Ira B. in our ward. She had also been raped. True, she didn't have any serious bodily injuries, but when she told me what had happened at their place, I felt worse for them than I did for us. Because when they raped Ira her daughter was in the room, she was under the bed on which it happened. And Ira was holding her daughter's hand, the one who was hiding under the bed. When they were beating Ira or taking her earrings off, gold, when she involuntarily let go of her daughter's hand, her daughter took her hand again. Her daughter is in the fourth grade, she's 11 years old. I felt really awful when I heard that. Ira asked them not to harm her daughter, she said, "Do what you want with me, just leave my daughter alone." Well, they did what they wanted. They threatened to kill her daughter if she got in their way. Now I would be surprised if the criminals had behaved any other way that night. It was simply Bartholomew's Night, I say, they did what they would love to do every day: steal, kill, rape . . . Many are surprised that those animals didn't harm the children. The beasts explained it like this: this would be repeated in 15 to 20 years, and those children would be grown, and then, as they put it, "we'll come take the pleasure out of their lives, those children." This was about the girls that would be young women in 15 years. They were thinking about their tomorrow because they were sure that there would be no trial and no investigation, just as there was no trial or investigation in 1915, and that those girls could be of some use in 15 years. This I heard from the investigators; one of the victims testified to it. That's how they described their own natures, that they would still be bloodthirsty in 15 to 20 years, and in 100 years--they themselves said that. And this, too. Everyone is surprised that they didn't harm our Marina. Many people say that they either were drunk or had smoked too much. I don't know why their eyes were red. Maybe because they hadn't slept the night before, maybe for some other reason, I don't know. But they hadn't been smoking and they weren't drunk, I'm positive, because someone who has smoked will stop at nothing he has the urge to do. And they spoke in a cultured fashion with Marina: "Little sister, don't be afraid, we won't harm you, don't look over there [where I was], you might be frightened. You're a Muslim, a Muslim woman shouldn't see such things." So they were really quite sober . . . So we came out of that story alive. Each every day we have lived since it all happened bears the mark of that day. It wasn't even a day, of those several hours. Father still can't look us in the eyes. He still feels guilty for what happened to Karina, Mother, and me. Because of his nerves he's started talk- ing to himself, I've heard him argue with himself several times when he thought no one is listening: "Listen," he'll say, "what could I do? What could I do alone, how could I protect them?" I don't know where to find the words, it's not that I'm happy, but I am glad that he didn't see it all happen. That's the only thing they spared us . . . or maybe it happened by chance. Of course he knows it all, but there's no way you could imagine every last detail of what happened. And there were so many conversations: Karina and I spoke together in private, and we talked with Mamma, too. But Father was never present at those conversations. We spare him that, if you can say that. And when the investigator comes to the house, we don't speak with Father present. On February 29, the next clay, Karina and I were discharged from the hospital. First they released me, but since martial law had been declared in the city, the soldiers took me to the police precinct in an armored personnel carrier. There were many people there, Armenian victims. I met the Tovmasian family there. From them I learned that Rafik and their Uncle Grant had died. They were sure that both had died. They were talking to me and Raya, Rafik's wife and Grant's daughter, and her mother, were both crying. Then they took us all out of the office on the first floor into the yard. There's a little one-room house outside there, a recreation and reading area. They took us in there. The women were afraid to go because they thought that they were shooing us out of the police precinct because it had become so dangerous that even the people working at the precinct wanted to hide. The women were shouting. They explained to them: "We want to hide you better because it's possible there will be an attack on the police precinct." We went into the little house. There were no chairs or tables in there. We had children with us and they were hungry; we even had infants who needed to have their diapers changed. No one had anything with them. It was just awful. They kept us there for 24 hours. From the window of the one room house you could see that there were Azerbaijanis standing on the fences around the police precinct, as though they were spying on us. The police precinct is surrounded by a wall, like a fence, and it's electrified, but if they were standing on the wall, it means the electricity was shut off. This brought great psychological pressure to bear on us, particularly on those who hadn't just walked out of their apartments, but who hadn't slept for 24 hours, or 48, or those who had suffered physically and spiritually, the ones who had lost family members. For us it was another ordeal. We were especially frightened when all the precinct employees suddenly disappeared. We couldn't see a single person, not in the courtyard and not in the windows. We thought that they must have already been hiding under the building, that they must have some secret room down there. People were panicking: they started throwing themselves at one another . . . That's the way it is on a sinking ship. We heard those people, mainly young people, whistling and whopping on the walls. We felt that the end was approaching. I was completely terrified: I had left Karina in the hospital and didn't know where my parents were. I was sort of calm about my parents, I was thinking only about Karina, if, Heaven forbid, they should attack the hospital, they would immediately tell them that there was an Armenian in there, and something terrible would happen to Karina again, and she wouldn't be able to take it. Then soldiers with dogs appeared. When they saw the dogs some of the people climbed down off the fence. Then they brought in about another 30 soldiers. They all had machine guns in readiness, their fingers on the triggers. We calmed down a little. They brought us chairs and brought the children some little cots and showed us where we could wash our hands, and took the children to the toilet. But we all sat there hungry, but to be honest, it would never have occurred to any of us that we hadn't eaten for two days and that people do eat. Then, closer to nightfall, they brought a group of detained criminals. They were being watched by soldiers with guard dogs. One of the men came back from the courtyard and told us about it. Raya Tovmasian . . . it was like a different woman had been substituted. Earlier she had been crying, wailing, and calling out: "Oh, Rafik!," but when she heard about this such a rage came over her! She jumped up, she had a coat on, and she started to roll up her sleeves like she was getting ready to beat someone. And suddenly there were soldiers, and dogs, and lots of people. She ran over to them. The bandits were standing there with their hands above their heads facing the wall. She went up to one of them and grabbed him by the collar and started to shake and thrash him! Then, on to a second, and a third. Everyone was rooted to the spot. Not one of the soldiers moved, no one went up to help or made her stop her from doing it. And the bandits fell down and covered their heads with their hands, muttering something. She came back and sat down, and something akin to a smile appeared on her face. She became so quiet: no tears, no cries. Then that round was over and she went back to beat them again. She was walking and cursing terribly: take that, and that, they killed my husband, the bastards, the creeps, and so on. Then she came back again and sat down. She probably did this the whole night through, well, it wasn't really night, no one slept. She went five or six times and beat them and returned. And she told the women, "What are you sitting there for? They killed your husbands and children, they raped, and you're just sitting there. You're sitting and talking as though nothing had happened. Aren't you Armenians?" She appealed to everyone, but no one got up. I was just numb, I didn't have the strength to beat anyone, I could barely hold myself up, all the more so since I had been standing for so many hours--I was released at eleven o'clock in the morning and it was already after ten at night because there weren't enough chairs, really it was the elderly and women with children who sat. I was on my feet the whole time. There was nothing to breathe, the door was closed, and the men were smoking. The situation was deplorable. At eleven o'clock at night policemen came for us, local policemen, Azerbaijanis. They said, "Get up. They've brought mattresses, you can wash up and put the children to bed." Now the women didn't want to leave this place, either. The place had become like home, it was safe, there were soldiers with dogs. If anyone went outside, the soldiers would say, "Oh, it's our little family," and things like that. The soldiers felt this love, and probably, for the first time in their lives perceived themselves as defenders. Everyone spoke from the heart, cried, and hugged them and they, with their loaded machine guns in their hands, said, "Grandmother, you mustn't approach me, I'm on guard." Our people would say, "Oh, that's all right." They hugged them, one woman even kissed one of the machine guns. This was all terribly moving for me. And the small children kept wanting to pet the dogs. They took us up to the second floor and said, "You can undress and sleep in here. Don't be afraid, the precinct is on guard, and it's quiet in the city." This was the 29th, when the killing was going on in block 41A and in other places. Then we were told that all the Armenians were being gathered at the SK club and at the City Party Committee. They took us there. On the way I asked them to stop at the Maternity Home: I wanted to take Karina with me. I didn't know what was happening there. They told me, "Don't worry, the Maternity Home is full of soldiers, more than mothers-to-be. So you can rest assured. I say, "Well, I won't rest assured regardless, because the staff in there is capable of anything." When I arrived at the City Party Committee it turned out that Karina had already been brought there. They had seen fit to release her from the hospi- tal, deciding that she felt fine and was no longer in need of any care. Once we were in the City Party Committee we gave free reign to our tears. We met acquaintances, but everyone was somehow divided into two groups, those who hadn't been injured, who were clothed, who had brought a pot of food with them, and so on, and those, like me, like Raya, who were wearing whatever had come their way. There were even people who were all made up, dolled up like they had come from a wedding. There were people without shoes, naked people, hungry people, those who were crying, and those who had lost someone. And of course the stories and the talk were flying: "Oh, I heard that they killed him!" "What do you mean they killed him!" "He stayed at work!" "Do you know what's happening at this and such a plant? Talk like that. And then I met Aleksandr Mikhailovich Gukasian, the teacher. I know him very well and respect him highly. I've known him for a long time. They had a small room, well really it was more like a study-room. We spent a whole night talking in that study once. On March 1 we heard that Bagirov [First Secretary of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan SSR] had arrived. Everyone ran to see Bagirov, what news he had brought with him and how this was all being viewed from outside. He arrived and everyone went up to him to talk to him and ask him things. Everyone was in a tremendous rage. But he was protected by soldiers, and he went up to the second floor and didn't deign to speak with the people. Apparently he had more important things to do. Several hours passed. Gukasian called me and says, "Lyudochka, find another two or three. We're going to make up lists, they asked for them upstairs, lists of the dead, those whose whereabouts are unknown, and lists of people who had pogroms of their apartments and of those whose cars were burned." I had about 50 people in my list when they called me and said, "Lyuda, your Mamma has arrived, she's looking for you, she doesn't believe that you are alive and well and that you're here." I gave the lists to someone and asked them to continue what I was doing and went off. The list was imprecise, of course. It included Grant Adamian, Raya Tovmasian's father, who was alive, but at the time they thought him dead. There was Engels Grigorian's father and aunt, Cherkez and Maria. The list also included the name of my girlfriend and neighbor, Zhanna Agabekian. One of the guys said that he had been told that they chopped her head off in the courtyard in front of the Kosmos movie theater. We put her on the list too, and cried, but later it turned out that that was just a rumor, that in fact an hour earlier she had somehow left Sumgait for the marina and from there had set sail for Krasnovodsk, where, thank God, she was alive and well. I should also say that in addition to those who died that list contained people who were rumored missing or who were so badly wounded that they were given up for dead. 3 All the lists were taken to Bagirov. I don't remember how many dead were contained in the list, but it's a fact that when Gukasian came in a couple of minutes later he was cursing and was terribly irate. I asked, "What's going on?" He said, "Lyuda, can you imagine what animals, what scoundrels they are! They say that they lost the list of the dead. Piotr Demichev [Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the USSR] has just arrived, and we were supposed to submit the list to him, so that he'd see the scope of the slaughter, of the tragedy, whether it was one or fifty." They told him that the list had disappeared and they should ask everyone who hadn't left for the Khimik boarding house all over again. There were 26 people on our second list. I think that the number 26 was the one that got into the press and onto television and the radio, because that's the list that Demichev got. I remember exactly that there were 26 people on the list, I had even told Aleksandr Mikhailovich that that was only a half of those that were on the first list. He said, "Lyuda, please, try to remember at least one more." But I couldn't remember anyone else. But there were more than 30 dead. Of that I am certain. The government and the Procuracy don't count the people who died of fright, like sick people and old people whose lives are threatened by any shock. They weren't registered as victims of the Sumgait tragedy. And then there may be people we didn't know. So many people left Sumgait between March 1 and 8! Most of them left for smaller towns in Russia, and especially to the Northern Caucasus, to Stavropol, and the Krasnodarsk Territory. We don't have any information on them. I know that there are people who set out for parts around Moscow. In the periodical Krestyanka [Woman Farmer] there was a call for people who know how to milk cows, and for mechanics, and drivers, and I know a whole group of people went to help out. Also clearly not on our list are those people who died entering the city, who were burned in their cars. No one knows about them, except the Azerbaijanis, who are hardly likely to say anything about it. And there's more. A great many of the people who were raped were not included in the list drawn up at the Procuracy. I know of three instances for sure, and I of course don't know them all. I'm thinking of three women whose parents chose not to publicize what had happened, that is, they didn't take the matter to court, they simply left. But in so doing they didn't cease being victims. One of them is the first cousin of my classmate Kocharian. She lived in Microdistrict No. 8, on the fifth floor. I can't tell you the building number and I don't know her name. Then comes the neighbor of one of my relatives, she lived in Microdistrict 1 near the gift shop. I don't know her name, she lives on the same landing as the Sumgait procurator. They beat her father, he was holding the door while his daughter hid, but he couldn't hold the door forever, and when she climbed over the balcony to the neighbors' they seized her by her braid. Like the Azerbaijanis were saying, it was a very cultured mob, because they didn't kill anyone, they only raped them and left. And the third one . . . I don't remember who the third one was anymore. They transferred us on March 1. Karina still wasn't herself. Yes, we lived for days in the SK, in the cultural facility, and at the Khimik. They lived there and I lived at the City Party Committee because I couldn't stay with Karina; it was too difficult for me, but I was at peace: she had survived. I could already walk, but really it was honest words that held me up. Thanks to the social work I did there, I managed to persevere. Aleksandr Mikhailovich said, "If it weren't for the work I would go insane." He and I put ourselves in gear and took everything upon ourselves: someone had an infant and needed diapers and free food, and we went to get them. The first days we bought everything, although we should have received it for free. They were supposed to have been dispensed free of charge, and they sold it to us. Then, when we found out it was free, we went to Krayev. At the time, fortunately, you could still drop by to see him like a neighbor, all the more so since everything was still clearly visible on our faces. Krayev sent a captain down and he resolved the issue. On March 2 they sent two investigators to see us: Andrei Shirokov and Vladimir Fedorovich Bibishev. The way it worked out, in our family they had considered only Karina and me victims, maybe because she and I wound up in the hospital. Mother and Father are considered witnesses, but not victims. Shirokov was involved with Karina's case, and Bibishev, with mine. After I told him everything, he and I planned to sit down with the identikit and record everyone I could remember while everything was still fresh in my mind. We didn't work with the identikit until the very last day because the conditions weren't there. The investigative group worked slowly and did poor quality work solely because the situation wasn't conducive to working: there weren't enough automobiles, especially during the time when there was a curfew, and there were no typewriters for typing transcripts, and no still or video cameras. I think that this was done on purpose. We're not so poor that we can't supply our investigators with all that stuff. It was done especially to draw out the investigation, all the more so since the local authorities saw that the Armenians were leaving at the speed of light, never to return to Sumgait. And the Armenians had a lot to say I came to an agreement with Bibishev, I told him myself, "Don't you worry, if it takes us a month or two months, I'll be here. I'm not afraid, I looked death in the eyes five times in those two days, I'll help you conduct the investigation." He and I worked together a great deal, and I used this to shelter Karina, I gave them so much to do that for a while they didn't have the time to get to her, so that she would at least have a week or two to get back to being her- self. She was having difficulty breathing so we looked for a doctor to take x- rays. She couldn't eat or drink for nine days, she was nauseous. I didn't eat and drank virtually nothing for five days. Then, on the fifth day, when we were in Baku already, the investigator told me, "How long can you go on like this? Well fine, so you don't want to eat, you don't love yourself, you're not taking care of yourself, but you gave your word that you would see this investigation through. We need you." Then I started eating, because in fact I was exhausted. It wasn't enough that I kept seeing those faces in our apart- ment in my mind, every day I went to the investigative solitary confinement cells and prisons. I don't know . . . we were just everywhere! Probably in every prison in the city of Baku and in all the solitary confinement cells of Sumgait. At that time they had even turned the drunk tank into solitary confinement. Thus far I have identified 31 of the people who were in our apartment. Mamma identified three, and Karina, two. The total is 36. Marina didn't identify anyone, she remembers the faces of two or three, But they weren't among the photographs of those detained. I told of the neighbor I recognized. The one who went after the axe. He still hasn't been detained, he's still on the loose. He's gone, and it's not clear if he will be found or not. I don't know his first or last name. I know which building he lived in and I know his sisters' faces. But he's not in the city. The investigators informed me that even if the investigation is closed and even if the trial is over they will continue looking for him. The 31 people I identified are largely blue-collar workers from various plants, without education, and of the very lowest level in every respect. Mostly their ages range from 20 to 30 years; there was one who was 48. Only one of them was a student. He was attending the Azerbaijan Petroleum and Chemical Institute in Sumgait, his mother kept trying to bribe the investiga- tor. Once, thinking that I was an employee and not a victim, she said in front of me "I'll set you up a restaurant worth 500 rubles and give you 600 in cash simply for keeping him out of Armenia," that is, to keep him from landing in a prison on Armenian soil. They're all terribly afraid of that, because if the investigator is talking with a criminal and the criminal doesn't confess even though we identified him, they tell him--in order to apply psychological pressure--they say, "Fine, don't confess, just keep silent. When you're in an Armenian prison, when they find out who you are, they'll take care of you in short order." That somehow gets to them. Many give in and start to talk. The investigators and I were in our apartment and videotaped the entire pogrom of our apartment, as an investigative experiment. It was only then that I saw the way they had left our apartment. Even without knowing who was in our apartment, you could guess. They stole, for example, all the money and all the valuables, but didn't take a single book. They tore them up, burned them, poured water on them, and hacked them with axes. Only the Materials from the 27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and James Fenimore Cooper's Last of the Mohigans. Oh yes, lunch was ready, we were boiling a chicken, and there were lemons for tea on the table. After they had been in our apartment, both the chicken and the lemons were gone. That's enough to tell you what kind of people were in our apartment, people who don't even know anything about books. They didn't take a single book, but they did take worn clothing, food, and even the cheapest of the cheap, worn-out slippers. Of those whom I identified, four were Kafan Azerbaijanis living in Sumgait. Basically, the group that went seeking "revenge"--let's use their word for it--was joined by people seeking easy gain and thrill-seekers. I talked with one of them. He had gray eyes, and somehow against the back-drop of all that black I remembered him specifically because of his of his eyes. Besides taking part in the pogrom of our apartment, he was also involved in the murder of Tamara Mekhtiyeva from Building 16. She was an older Armenian who had recently arrived from Georgia, she lived alone and did not have anyone in Sumgait. I don't know why she had a last name like that, maybe she was married to an Azerbaijani. I had laid eyes on this woman only once or twice, and know nothing about her. I do know that they murdered her in her apartment with an axe. Murdering her wasn't enough for them. They hacked her into pieces and threw them into the tub with water. I remember another guy really well too, he was also rather fair-skinned. You know, all the people who were in our apartment were darker than dark, both their hair and their skin. And in contrast with them, in addition to the grey- eyed one, I remember this one fellow, the one l took to be a Lezgin. I identified him. As it turned out he was Eduard Robertovich Grigorian, born in the city of Sumgait, and he had been convicted twice. One of our own. How did I remember him? The name Rita was tattooed on his left or right hand. I kept thinking, is that Rita or "puma," which it would be if you read the word as Latin characters instead of Cyrillic, because the Cyrillic "T" was the one that looks like a Latin "M." When they led him in he sat with his hands behind his back. This was at the confrontation. He swore on every holy book, tried to put in an Armenian word here and there to try and spark my compassion, and told me that I was making a mistake, and called me "dear sister." He said, "You're wrong, how could I, an Armenian, raise my hand against my own, an Armenian," and so on. He spoke so convincingly that even the investigator asked me, "Lyuda, are you sure it was he?" I told him, "I'll tell you one more identifying mark. If I'm wrong I shall apologize and say I was mistaken. The name Rita is tattooed on his left or right hand." He went rigid and became pale. They told him, "Put your hands on the table." He put his hands on the table with the palms up. I said, "Now turn your hands over," but he didn't turn his hands over. Now this infuriated me. If he had from the very start acknowledged his guilt and said that he hadn't wanted to do it, that they forced him or something else, I would have treated him somewhat differently. But he insolently stuck to his story, "No, I did not do anything, it wasn't me." When they turned his hands over the name Rita was in fact tattooed on his hand. His face distorted and he whispered something wicked. I immediately flew into a rage. There was an ashtray on the table, a really heavy one, made out of granite or something, very large, and it had ashes and butts in it. Catching myself quite by surprise, I hurled that ashtray at him. But he ducked and the ashtray hit the wall, and ashes and butts rained down on his head and back. And he smiled. When he smiled it provoked me further. I don't know how, but I jumped over the table between us and started either pounding him or strangling him; I no longer remember which. When I jumped I caught the microphone cord. The investigator was there, Tolya . . .I no longer recall his last name, and he says, "Lyudochka, it's a Japanese microphone! Please . . . " And shut off all the equipment on the spot, it was all being video taped. They took him away. I stayed, and they talked to me a little to calm me down, because we needed to go on working, I only remember Tolya telling me, "You're some actress! What a performance!" I said, "Tolya, honestly . . . " Beforehand they would always tell me, "Lyuda, more emotion. You speak as calmly as if nothing had happened to you." I say, "I don't have any more strength or emotion. All my emotions are behind me now, I no longer have the strength . . . I don't have the strength to do anything." And he says, "Lyuda, how were you able to do that?" And when I returned to normal, drinking tea and watching the tape, I said, "Can I really have jumped over that table? I never jumped that high in gym class." So you could say the gang that took over our apartment was international. Of the 36 we identified there was an Armenian, a Russian, Vadim Vorobyev, who beat Mamma, and 34 Azerbaijanis. At the second meeting with Grigorian, when he had completely confessed his guilt, he told of how on February 27 the Azerbaijanis had come knocking. Among them were guys--if you can call them guys--he knew from prison. They said, "Tomorrow we're going after the Armenians. Meet us at the bus station at three o'clock." He said, "No, I'm not coming." They told him, "If you don't come we'll kill you." He said, "Alright, I'll come." And he went. They also went to visit my classmate from our microdistrict, Kamo Pogosian. He had also been in prison; I think that together they had either stolen a motorcycle or dismantled one to get some parts they needed. They called him out of his apartment and told him the same thing: "Tomorrow we're going to get the Armenians. Be there." He said, "No." They pulled a knife on him. He said, "I'm not going all the same." And in the courtyard on the 27th they stabbed him several times, in the stomach. He was taken to the hospital. I know he was in the hospital in Baku, in the Republic hospital. If we had known about that we would have had some idea of what was to come on the 28th. I'll return to Grigorian, what he did in our apartment. I remember that he beat me along with all the rest. He spoke Azerbaijani extremely well. But he was very fair-skinned, maybe that led me to think that they had it out for him, too. But later it was proved that he took part in the beating and burning of Shagen Sargisian. I don't know if he participated in the rapes in our apartment; I didn't see, I don't remember. But the people who were in our apartment who didn't yet know that he was an Armenian said that he did. I don't know if he confessed or not, and I myself don't recall because I blacked out very often. But I think that he didn't participate in the rape of Karina because he was in the apartment the whole time. When they carried her into the courtyard, he remained in the apartment. At one point I was talking with an acquaintance about Edik Grigorian. From her I learned that his wife was a dressmaker, his mother is Russian, he doesn't have a father, and that he's been convicted twice. Well this will be his third and, I hope, last sentence. He beat his wife, she was eternally coming to work with bruises. His wife was an Armenian by the name of Rita. The others who were detained . . . well they're little beasts. You really can't call them beasts, they're just little beasts. They were robots carrying out someone else's will, because at the investigation they all said, "I don't understand how I could have done that, I was out of my head." But we know that they were won around to it and prepared for it, that's why they did it. In the name of Allah, in the name of the Koran, in the name of propagating Islam-- that's holy to them--that's why they did everything they were commanded to do. Because I saw they didn't have minds of their own, I'm not talking about their level of cultural sophistication or any higher values. No education, they work, have a slew of children without the means to raise them properly, they crowd them in, like at the temporary housing, and apparently, they were promised that if they slaughtered the Armenians they would receive apartments. So off they went. Many of them explained their participation saying, "they promised us apartments." Among them was one who genuinely repented. I am sure that he repented from the heart and that he just despised himself after the incident. He worked at a children's home, an Azerbaijani, he has two children, and his wife works at the children's home too. Everything that they acquired, everything that they have they earned by their own labor, and wasn't inherited from parents or grandparents. And he said, "I didn't need anything I just don't know . . . how I ended up in that; it was like some hand was guiding me. I had no will of my own, I had no strength, no masculine dignity, nothing." And the whole time I kept repeating, "Now you imagine that someone did the same to your young wife right before your own eyes." He sat there and just wailed. But that leader in the Eskimo dogskin coat was not detained. He performed a marvelous disappearing act, but I think that they'll get onto him, they just have to work a little, because that Vadim, that boy, according to his grandfather, is in touch with the young person who taught him what to do, how to cover his tracks. He was constantly exchanging jackets with other boys he knew and those he didn't, either, and other things as well, and changed himself like a chameleon so they wouldn't get onto him, but he was detained. That one in the Eskimo dogskin coat was at the Gambarians' after Aleksandr Gambarian was murdered. He came in and said, "Let's go, enough, you've spilled enough blood here." Maybe Karina doesn't know this but the reason they didn't finish her off was that they were hoping to take her home with them. I heard this from Aunt Tanya and her sons, the Kasumovs, who were in the courtyard near the entryway. They liked her very much, and they had decided to take her to home with them. When Karina came to at one point--she doesn't remember this yet, this the neighbors old me--and she saw that there was no one around her, she started crawling to the entryway. They saw that she was still alive and came back, they were already at the third entryway, on their way to the Gambarians'. They came back and started beating her to finish her. If she had not come to she would have sustained lesser bodily injuries, they would have beat her less. An older woman from our building, Aunt Nazan, an Azerbaijani, all but lay on top of Karina, crying and pleading that they leave her alone, but they flung her off. The woman's grown sons were right nearby; they picked her up in their hands and led her home. She howled and cried out loudly and swore: God is on Earth, he sees everything, and He won't forgive this. There was another woman, too, Aunt Fatima, a sick, aging woman from the first floor, she's already retired. Mountain dwellers, and Azerbaijanis, too, have a custom: If men are fighting, they throw a scarf under their feet to stop them. But they trampled her scarf and sent her home. To trample a scarf is tantamount to trampling a woman's honor. Now that the investigation is going on, now that a lot is behind us and we have gotten back to being ourselves a little, I think about how could these events that are now called the Sumgait tragedy happen? How did they come about? How did it start? Could it have been avoided? Well, it's clear that without a signal, without permission from the top leadership, it would not have happened. All the same, I'm not afraid to say this, the Azerbaijanis, let other worthy people take no offense, the better representatives of their nations, let them take no offense, but the Azerbaijanis in their majority are a people who are kept in line only by fear of the law, fear of retribution for what they have done. And when the law said that they could do all that, like unleashed dogs who were afraid they wouldn't have time to do everything, they threw themselves from one thing to the next so as to be able to get more done, to snatch a bit more. The smell of the danger was already in the air on February 27. You could tell that something was going to happen. And everyone who had figured it out took steps to avoid running into those gangs. Many left for their dachas, got plane tickets for the other end of the country, just got as far away as their legs would carry them. February 27 was a Saturday. I was teaching my third class. The director came into my classroom and said that I should let the children out, that there had been a call from the City Party Committee asking that all teachers gather for a meeting at Lenin Square. Well, I excused the children, and there were few teachers left at school, altogether three women, the director, and six or seven men. The rest had already gone home. We got to Lenin Square and there were a great many people there. This was around five-thirty or six in the evening, no later. They were saying all kinds of rubbish up on the podium and the crowd below was supporting them stormily, roaring. They spoke over the microphone about what had happened in Kafan a few days earlier and that the driver of a bus going to some district had recently thrown a small Azerbaijani child off the bus. The speaker affirmed that he was an eyewitness, that he had seen it himself..The crowd started to rage: "Death to the Armenians! They must be killed!" Then a woman went up on stage. I didn't see the woman because people were clinging to the podium like flies. I could only hear her. The woman introduced herself as coming from Kafan, and said that the Armenians cut her daughters' breasts off, and called, "Sons, avenge my daughters!" That was enough. A portion of the people on the square took off running in the direction of the factories, toward the beginning of Lenin Street. We stood there about an hour. Then the director of School 25 spoke, he gave a very nationalist speech. He said, "Brother Muslims, kill the Armenians!" This he repeated every other sentence. When he said this the crowd supported him stormily, whistling and shouting "Karabagh!" He said, "Karabagh has been our territory my whole life long, Karabagh is my soul. How can you tear out my heart?" As though an Azerbaijani would die without Karabagh. "It's our territory, the Armenians will never see it. The Armenians must be eliminated. From time immemorial Muslims have cleansed the land of infidel Armenians, from time immemorial, that's the way nature created it, that every 20 to 30 years the Azerbaijanis should cleanse the land of filth." By filth he meant Armenians. I heard this. Before that I hadn't been listening to the speeches closely. Many people spoke and I stood with my back to the podium, talking shop with the other teachers, and somehow it all went right by, it didn't penetrate, that in fact something serious was taking place. Then, when one of our teachers said, "Listen to what he's saying, listen to what idiocy he's spouting," we listened. That was the speech of that director. Before that we listened to the woman's speech. Right then in our group--there were nine of us--the mood changed, and the subject of conversation and all school matters were forgotten. Our director of studies, for whom I had great respect, he's an Azerbaijani . . . Before that I had considered him an upstanding and worthy person, if there was a need to obtain leave we had asked him, he seemed like a good person. So he tells me, "Lyuda, you know that besides you there are no Armenians on the square? If they find out that you're an Armenian they'll tear you to pieces. Should I tell them you're an Armenian? Should I tell them you're an Armenian?" When he said it the first time I pretended not to hear it, and then he asked me a second time. I turned to the director, Khudurova, and said that it was already after eight, I was expected at home, and I should be leaving. She answered, "No, they said that women should stay here until ten o'clock,.and men, until twelve. Stay here." There was a young teacher with us, her children were in kindergarten and her husband worked shifts. She asked to leave: "I left my children at the kindergarten." The director excused her. When she let her go I turned around, said, "Good-bye," and left with the young teacher, the Azerbaijani. I didn't see them after that. When we were walking the buses weren't running, and a crowd from the rally ran nearby us. They had apparently gotten all fired up. It must have become too much for them, and they wanted to seek vengeance immediately, so they rushed off. I wasn't afraid this time because I was sure that the other teacher wouldn't say that I was an Armenian. To make it short, we reached home. Then Karina told of how they had been at the movies and what had happened there. I started telling of my experience and again my parents didn't understand that we were in danger. We watched television as usual, and didn't even imagine that tomorrow would be our last day. That's how it all was. At the City Party Committee I met an acquaintance, we went to school together, Zhanna, I don't remember her last name, she lives above the housewares store on Narimanov Street. She was there with her father, for some reason she doesn't have a mother. The two of them were at home alone. While her father held the door she jumped from the third floor, and she was lucky that the ground was wet and that there wasn't anyone behind the building when she went out on the balcony, there was no one there, they were all standing near the entryway. That building was also a lucky one in that there were no murders there. She jumped. She jumped and didn't feel any pain in the heat of the moment. A few days later I found out that she couldn't stand up, she had been injured somehow. That's how people in Sumgait saved their lives, their honor, and their children: any way they could. Where it was possible, the Armenians fought back. My father's first cousin, Armen M., lives in Block 30. They found out by phone from one of the victims what was going on in town. The Armenians in that building all called one another immediately and all of them armed themselves with axes, knives, even with muskets and went up to the roof. They took their infants with them, and their old women who had been in bed for God knows how many months, they got them right out of their beds and took everyone upstairs. They hooked electricity up to the trap door to the roof and waited, ready to fight. Then they took the daughter of the school board director hostage, she's an Azerbaijani who lived in their building. They called the school board director and told her that if she didn't help them, the 17 Armenians on the roof, to escape alive and unharmed, she'd never see her daughter again. I'm sure, of course, that Armenians would never lay a hand on a woman, it was just the only thing that could have saved them at the time. She called the police. The Armenians made a deal with the local police to go into town. Two armored personnel carriers and soldiers were summoned They surrounded the entryway and led everyone down from the roof, and off to the side from the armored personnel carriers was a crowd that was on its way to the building at that very moment, into Block 30. That's how they defended themselves. I heard that our neighbors, Roman and Sasha Gambarian, resisted. They're big, strong guys. Their father was killed. And I heard that the brothers put up a strong defense and lost their father, but were able to save their mother. One of the neighbors told me that after it happened, when they were looking for the criminals on March 1 to 2 and detaining everyone they suspected, people hid people in our entryway, maybe people who were injured or perhaps dead. The neighbors themselves were afraid to go there, and when they went with the soldiers into our basement they are supposed to have found Azerbaijani corpses. I don't know how many. Even if they had been wounded and put down there, after two days they would have died from loss of blood or infection--that basement was filled with water. I heard this from the neighbors. And later when I was talking with the investigators the subject came up and they confirmed it. I know, too, that for several hours the basement was used to store objects stolen from our apartment. And our neighbor carried out our carpet, along with the rest: he stole it for himself, posing as one of the criminals. Everyone was taking his own share, and the neighbor took his, too, and carried it home. And when we came back, when everything seemed to have calmed down, he returned it, saying that it was the only thing of ours he had managed to "save." Raya's husband and father defended themselves. The Trdatovs defended themselves, and so did other Armenian families. To be sure there were Azerbaijani victims, although we'll never hear anything about them. For some reason our government doesn't want to say that the Armenians were not just victims, but that they defended the honor of their sisters and mothers, too. In the TV show "Pozitsiya" [Viewpoint] a military man, an officer, said that the Armenians did virtually nothing to defend themselves. But that's not important, the truth will come out regardless. So that's the price we paid those three days. For three days our courage, our bravery, and our humanity was tested. It was those three days, and not the years and dozens of years we had lived before them, that showed what we've become, what we grew up to be. Those three days showed who was who. On that I will conclude my narrative on the Sumgait tragedy. It should be said that it's not over yet, the trials are still ahead of us, and the punishments received by those who so violated us, who wanted to make us into nonhumans will depend on our position and on the work of the investigators, the Procuracy, and literally of every person who lent his hand to the investiga- tion. That's the price we paid to live in Armenia, to not fear going out on the street at night, to not be afraid to say we're Armenians, and to not fear speaking our native tongue.

With regards to my condemnation of Marc's ridiculous attacks on the American Department of Justice, and further attacks on Jews, to anyone who took offense to my calling Marc stupid, I apologize for pointing out the obvious. It was a waste of the Net's time. I hope, though, that most American citizens have the basic knowlege of the structure of American government to understand the relationship between the Justice Department as a part of the Executive Branch, and the Courts, which are of the Judicial Branch. Marc's ignorance of basic civic knowlege underscores his inability to comprehend and interpret foreign affairs. Peace, Pete

Not only because it is the polite thing to do, but also to avoid addressing ladies with "Mr.", as you have done. Secondly, the island of which the name is more correctly spelled as Cyprus has never been Greek, but rather, it has been home to a bi-communal society formed of Greeks and Turks. It seems that you know as little about the history and the demography of the island, as you know about the essence of Turkey's military intervention to it under international agreements. Be that as it may, an analogy between an act of occupation in history and what is going on today on Azerbaijani land, can only be drawn with the expansionist policy that Armenia is now pursuing. But, I could agree that it is not for us to issue diagnoses to the political conduct of countries, and promulgate them in such terminology as "itchy-bitchy"... Onur Yalcin --

Why do American authorities consider Yigal Arens to be dangerous? I'm not aware that the US government considers me dangerous. In any case, that has nothing to do with the current case.

By that I refer to things such as: address and phone number, vehicle registration and license information, photographs, etc. > 2. Why does the ADL have an interest in that person ? You should ask the ADL, if you want an authoritative answer. My guess is that they collected information on anyone who did or might engage in political criticism of Israel. I further believe that they did this as agents of the Israeli government, or at least in agreement with them. At least some of the information collected by the ADL was passed on to Israeli officials. In some cases it was used to influence, or attempt to influence, people's access to jobs or public forums. These matters will be brought out as the court case unfolds, since California law entitles people to compensation if such actions can be proven. As my previous posting shows, California law entitles people to compensation even in the absence of any specific consequences -- just for the further dissemination of certain types of private information about them. -- Yigal Arens USC/ISI TV made me do it! arens@isi.edu

Let us not forget the Nazi Armenians. Nazi Armenians were of service to Germans in Arab countries as well. As Uzun put it, one well-known case which received a lot of media-coverage involved two Nazi Armenian agents which were dropped over Syria by Italian war planes. The mission of the agents was to mingle among the Armenian population in Syria and to acquire relevant information for the German Wehrmacht on the allied forces in the area.[1] Nazi Armenians also helped German propaganda efforts in Arab countries designed to promote pro-Nazi sentiments among the French- and British-ruled Arab populations. Beirut had traditionally been strong-hold of the Nazi Armenians and until very recently it was the center of international Armenian terrorism. In Russia General Dro (the Butcher), the architect of the Turkish genocide in WWI, was working closely with the German Secret Service. He entered the war zone with his own men and acquired important intelligence about the Soviets. His experience with the Turkish genocide in x-Soviet Armenia made him an invaluable source for the Germans.[2] [1] Meyer, Berkian, ibid., p. 150.

Are you suggesting that we should forget the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people by the Armenians between 1914 and 1920? But most people aren't aware that in 1939 Hitler said that he would pattern his elimination of the Jews based upon what the Armenians did to Turkish people in 1914. 'After all, who remembers today the extermination of the Tartars?' (Adolf Hitler, August 22, 1939: Ruth W. Rosenbaum (Durusoy), "The Turkish Holocaust - Turk Soykirimi", p. 213.) I refer to the Turks and Kurds as history's forgotten people. It does not serve our society well when most people are totally unaware of what happened in 1914 where a vicious society, run by fascist Armenians, decided to simply use the phoniest of pretexts as an excuse, for wiping out a peace-loving, industrious, and very intelligent and productive ethnic group. What we have is a demand from the fascist government of x-Soviet Armenia to redress the wrongs that were done against our people. And the only way we can do that is if we can catch hold of and not lose sight of the historical precedence in this very century. We cannot reverse the events of the past, but we can and we must strive to keep the memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the Atlantic, so as to help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people because of their religion or their race. Which means that I support the claims of the Turks and Kurds to return to their lands in x-Soviet Armenia, to determine their own future as a nation in their own homeland.

The atrocities committed by the Armenian volunteer forces accompanying the Russian army were so severe that the Russian commanders themselves were compelled to withdraw them from the fighting fronts and sent them to rear guard duties.

For nearly one thousand years, the Turkish and Kurdish people lived on their homeland - the last one hundred under the oppressive Soviet and Armenian occupation. The persecutions culminated in 1914: The Armenian Government planned and carried out a Genocide against its Muslim subjects. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their homeland. After one thousand years, Turkish and Kurdish lands were empty of Turks and Kurds. The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye. Today, x-Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x-Soviet Armenia. Today, x-Soviet Armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against humanity. x-Soviet Armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the Turks and Kurds. >You have now done so four times in a row.

To one brought up, as most Americans have been, in the Gladstonian and foreign-missionary tradition, the condition of the Jews in Turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious differences have had an influence in the tragedy of Turkey only as they were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every nation in the world would have treated as treasonable. One readily reaches the conclusion that the Jews in Turkey were fortunate..." He also stated that: "they [Armenians] traitorously turned Turkish cities over to the Russian invader; that they boasted of having raised an army of one hundred and fifty thousand men to fight a civil war, and that they burned at least a hundred Turkish villages and exterminated their population." : >I want the documents of Jews in Latvia.

"Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions, Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims. Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse to serve their state, the Ottoman Empire, and to assist instead other invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders, army officers, and common soldiers began deserting in droves." "With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of World War I, the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy increased drastically. Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks, Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations, who in turn massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of expected arrival of the invading Russian armies."

It could be, perhaps, your head wasn't screwed on just right. In 1941, while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration camps, the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion had grown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of the former guerilla leader Dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of the short-lived Armenian Dictatorship (1918-1920) and the architect of the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by this, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of extermination of the Jews. This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an "encore" performance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and exterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army. Furthermore, as McCarthy put it, the Armenian dictatorship was granted a respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros Armistice with the Allies (October 30, 1918). The Allies had decided to create a Greater Armenia, including the old Russian province of Yerevan and adjoining areas, as well as most parts of Anatolia claimed by the Armenian fanatics. Only the area called Cilicia (around the Ottoman province of Adana) was to be excluded, as it had already been claimed by the French. The Allies quickly set about attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks, who could be expected to oppose their plans. On April 19, 1919 the British Army occupied Kars, gave civilian and military power over to the Armenians, then withdrew. The British planned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship, even though the Russian pre-war census had shown Kars Province to be over 60% Muslim. The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed, but the British could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains. The fate of the Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier in Eastern Anatolia. Murder, pillage, genocide and the destruction of Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of Kars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded by remaining units of the Ottoman Army. The British had left the scene to the Armenian genocide squads. Therefore, few Europeans were present to observe the genocide. One British soldier, Colonel Rawlinson, who was assigned to supervise the disarmament of Otoman soldiers, saw what was occurring. Rawlinson wired to his superiors, "in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left in independent command of the Moslim population, as, their troops being without discipline and not being under effective control, atrocities were constantly being committed." >Instead, you post more Armenian nonsense: Come again? : "These European Dashnags, with headquarters in Berlin, appealed to... >(34 lines deleted) Why? : No wonder you are in such a mess.

All barracks buildings of Erzincan, the cavalry barracks in Erzurum, the Government building and Army Corps Headquarters are among those burnt. In short, both cities are burnt, destroyed and trees cut down. As to the people of these cities: All people old enough to use weapons rounded up, taken to the Sarikamis direction for road building and were slaughtered. The remaining people, were subject to cruelties and murder by Armenians following the withdrawal of Russians and were partly annihilated the corpses thrown into wells, burnt in houses, mutilated by bayonets, their abdomens ripped open in slaughterhouses, their lungs and livers torn out, girls and women hung up by their hair, after all kinds of devilish acts. The few people who were able to survive these cruelties, worse than those of the 'Spanish Inquisition,' are in poverty more dead than alive, horrified, some driven insane, about 1500 in Erzincan and 30,000 in Erzurum. The people are hungry and in poverty, for whatever they had has been taken away from them, their lands left uncultivated. The people have just been able to exist with some provisions found in stores left over from the Russians. The villages round Erzincan and Erzurum are in the worst condition.

You are making assumptions about the manner in which the cards are used. True, by law, all residents, citizens, and tourists must carry a form of identification with them. For citizens, the standard ID is the ID card. The purpose this serves on a daily basis, wherein they are presented at public places, is for the purpose of identifying the bearer. This takes place in banks (cashing checks), post offices (registered mail and such), etc... Quite frankly, it was rare that I ever had to present my ID card for such activities more than once per week. There is no law or requirement that forces people to wave their ID cards in public. Furthermore, none of the services I outlined discriminate against the bearer in any manner by having access to this information. The only case that I can think of in which the Le'um field might be taken into account is during interaction with the police, based upon the scenario. In general though, arab citizens are clearly recognizable, as are non-arabs. Your argument therefore becomes moot unless you can provide an example of how this field is being used to discriminate against them officially. |> In the answer to my second questions, concerning the fact that |> Israel has no fixed borders, you state that Israel's borders were |> 'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace'.

I think that Arab countries do know that they have nothing to fear from "Israeli expansionism". Militarily, Israel is not capable of holding onto large tracts of land under occupation to a hostile, armed, and insurgent population for a sustained period of time. As is, the intifada is heavily taxing the Israeli economy. Proof of this can be seen in the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon. Israeli troops pulled back from the Awali, and later from the Litani, in order to control the minimal strip needed to keep towns out of range of Katyusha missile fire. Public opinion in Israel has turned towards settling the intifada via territorial concessions. The Israel public is sufferring from battle fatigue of sorts and the gov't is aware of it. With regards to borders, let me state the following. I may not agree with the manner in which negotiations are being held, however the crux of the matter is that everyone either makes or refrains from stating a starting position. The arab parties have called for total withdrawal and a return to pre-48 borders. If Israel were to state large borders, the negotiations might never get under way. If Israel were to state smaller borders, then the arab countries might try and force even smaller borders during the negotiations. I think that leaving the matter to be settled by negotiations and peace treaties is infinitely more realistic and sensible. |> Your answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public |> official.

As to which were and which weren't, I am under no moral obligation to disclose that - quite the reverse in fact. He was taken to court, tried, and found guilty.

The CLU noted, which you evidently did not pay attention to, that they know of no such reports or cases. I am sorry to tell you but in a country of 4 mill, as tightly knit as Israel, even if the matter of the arrest was not made public, within a relatively short time frame, most people would know about it. My own feelings are that the matter of the arrest should be made public unless a court order is issued allowing a delay of X hours.

Such questions are often termed "tabloid journalism" and are not disturbing because they avoid any attempt at objectivity. Such questions were often used during the McCarthy era as a basis for the witch-hunts that took place then. To use your own example, these questions might have been lifted from the format used by Stalinist prosecutors that were looking for small bits of evidence that they could distort and portray as a larger and dirtier picture. My answers were not any more "hysterical" than the questions themselves. The problem is not that the q's were provocative, it was that they were selective in their fact seeking. You fall into the same category of those who seek "yes" "no" answers when the real answer is "of sorts". I suspect that as long as the answers to these questions is not an unequivocal NO, you would remain unsatified and choose to interprete them as you see fit. A sign of strength is the ability to look You remind me of those mistaken environmentalists who once advocated culling wolves because of the cruelty to deer, only to find that they had broken the food chain and wreaked havoc upon the very environment they sought to protect.

No, I am _not_ neglecting that, I'm merely asking you whether the existance of Israeli citicens in the WB or in Gaza invalidates those individuals right to live, a (as you so eloquently put it) human right. We can get back to the question of which law should be used in the territories later. Also, you have not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights. What do you expect me to tell you, Master of Wisdom, when I did explain my point in the post, that you "responded to". The point is that since Israel is occupying then it is automatically depriving itself from some of its rights to the Occupied Palestineans, which is exactly similar the automatic deprivation of a killer from his right of life to the society. If a state can deprive all it's citizens of human rights by its actions, then tell me why _any_ human living today should have any rights at all? |> |> In conjugtion with the above, when a group of people occupies others |> |> territories and rule them by force, then this group would be -willingly or |> |> unwillingly- deprived from some of its rights. |> Such as the right to live?

The question is NOT which system would solve the ME problem. Why ? because any system can solve it. The laws of minister Sharon says kick Palestineans out of here (all palestine). I asked for which system should be used, that will preserve human rights for all people involved. I assumed that was obvious, but I won't repeat that mistake. Now that I have straightened that out, I'm eagerly awaiting your reply. Joseph Weitz (administrator responsible for Jewish colonization) said it best when writing in his diary in 1940: "Between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both peoples together in this country.... We shall not achieve our goal ^^^ ^^^ of being an independent people with the Arabs in this small country. The only solution is a Palestine, at least Western Palestine (west of the Jordan river) without Arabs.... And there is no other way than to transfer the Arabs from here to the neighbouring countries, to transfer all of them; not one village, not one tribe, should be left.... Only after this transfer will the country be able to absorb the millions of our own brethren. There is no other way out." DAVAR, 29 September, 1967 ("Courtesy" of Marc Afifi) Just a question: If we are to disregard the rather obvious references to getting Israel out of ME one way or the other in both PLO covenant and HAMAS charter (that's the english translations, if you have other information I'd be interested to have you translate it) why should we give any credence to a _private_ paper even older? I'm not going to get into the question if he wrote the above, but it's fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have their share of fanatics. Guess what..? Those are not the people that will make any lasting peace in the region. Ever. It's those who are willing to make a tabula rasa and start over, and willing to give in order to get something back. "We" and "our" either refers to Zionists or Jews (i donot know which). Well, i can give you an answer, you Master of Wisdom, I will NOT suggest the imperialist israeli system for solving the ME problem ! I think that is fair enough . No, that is _not_ an answer, since I asked for a system that could solve the problem. You said any could be used, then you provided a contradiction. Guess where that takes your logic?

It is appropriate to add what Himmler said other "inferior races" and "human animals" in his speech at Posen and elsewhere: From the speech of Reichsfuehrer-SS Himmler, before SS Major-Generals, Posen, October 4 1943 ["Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression", Vol. IV, p. 559] ------------------------------------------------------------------- One basic principal must be the absolute rule for the SS man: we must be honest, decent, loyal, and comradely to members of our own blood and to nobody else. What happens to a Russian, to a Czech, does not interest me in the slightest. What the nations can offer in good blood of our type, we will take, if necessary by kidnapping their children and raising them with us. Whether nations live in prosperity or starve to death interests me only in so far as we need them as slaves for our culture; otherwise, it is of no interest to me. Whether 10,000 Russian females fall down from exhaustion while digging an anti-tank ditch interest me only in so far as the anti-tank ditch for Germany is finished. We shall never be rough and heartless when it is not necessary, that is clear. We Germans, who are the only people in the world who have a decent attitude towards animals, will also assume a decent attitude towards these human animals. But it is a crime against our own blood to worry about them and give them ideals, thus causing our sons and grandsons to have a more difficult time with them. When someone comes to me and says, "I cannot dig the anti-tank ditch with women and children, it is inhuman, for it will kill them", then I would have to say, "you are a murderer of your own blood because if the anti-tank ditch is not dug, German soldiers will die, and they are the sons of German mothers. They are our own blood". Extract from Himmler's address to party comrades, September 7 1940 ["Trials of Wa Criminals", Vol. IV, p. 1140] ------------------------------------------------------------------ If any Pole has any sexual dealing with a German woman, and by this I mean sexual intercourse, then the man will be hanged right in front of his camp. Then the others will not do it. Besides, provisions will be made that a sufficient number of Polish women and girls will come along as well so that a necessity of this kind is out of the question. The women will be brought before the courts without mercy, and where the facts are not sufficiently proved - such borderline cases always happen - they will be sent to a concentration camp. This we must do, unless these one million Poles and those hundreds of thousands of workers of alien blood are to inflict untold damage on the German blood. Philosophizing is of no avail in this case. It would be better if we did not have them at all - we all know that - but we need them. -Danny Keren.

Although I realize that principle is not one of your strongest points, I would still like to know why do do not ask any question of this sort about the Arab countries. If you want to continue this think tank charade of yours, your fixation on Israel must stop. You might have to start asking the same sort of questions of Arab countries as well. You realize it would not work, as the Arab countries' treatment of Jews over the last several decades is so bad that your fixation on Israel would begin to look like the biased attack that it is. Everyone in this group recognizes that your stupid 'Center for Policy Research' is nothing more than a fancy name for some bigot who hates Israel. Why don't you try being honest about your hatred of Israel? I have heard that your family once lived in Israel, but the members of your family could not cut the competition there. Is this true about your family? Is this true about you? Is this actually not about Israel, but is really a personal vendetta? Why are you not the least bit objective about Israel? Do you think that the name of your phony-baloney center hides your bias in the least? Get a clue, Mr. Davidsson. Haven't you realized yet that when you post such stupidity in this group, you are going to incur answers from people who are armed with the truth? Haven't you realized that a piece of selective data here and a piece there does not make up a truth? Haven't you realized that you are in over your head? The people who read this group are not as stupid as you would hope or need them to be. This is not the place for such pseudo-analysis. You will be continually ripped to shreds, until you start to show some regard for objectivity. Or you can continue to show what an anti-Israel zealot you are, trying to disguise your bias behind a pompous name like the 'Center for Policy Research.' You ought to know that you are a laughing stock, your 'Center' is considered a joke, and until you either go away, or make at least some attempt to be objective, you will have a place of honor among the clowns, bigots, and idiots of Usenet.

Those who forward offensive posts to the sysadmin aren't curtailing anyones' freedom of speech. The neo-nazi movement has a right to make speeches, say anything they want. They do not have a right to have these speeches published by the N.Y. Times. That depends on the Times analysis of the economic and to somewhat extent newsworthy value of those speeches. Likewise to the sysadmin of this fellows system. If he feels his resources are being used in a manner that is not in his best interests, or are perhaps embarassing to his organization, he will act just as the New York Times does, not to be a conduit for these ideas. The poster is after all free-loading off of someone else's pocket book when he posts. He who controls the purse strings has the right to make the decision how he wants those funds spent or not spent. Noone is going to put the poster in jail, unless he bombs a local building as a symbol of his hatred. Freedom of Speech in no way equates to accessibility to conduits of information. The market of ideas has its own "natural selection" process that weeds out the ga-ga from the credible ideas that are of importance.

As per request of Hasan: From _The Revolt_, by Menachem Begin, Dell Publishing, NY, 1977: [pp. 225-227] "Apart from the military aspect, there is a moral aspect to the story of Dir Yassin. At that village, whose name was publicized throughout the world, both sides suffered heavy casualties. We had four killed and nearly forty wounded. The number of casualties was nearly forty percent of the total number of the attackers. The Arab troops suffered casualties neraly three times as heavy. The fighting was thus very severe. Yet the hostile propaganda, disseminated throughout the world, deliberately ignored the fact that the civilian population of Dir Yassin was actually given a warning by us before the battle began. One of our tenders carrying a loud speaker was stationed at the entrance to the village and it exhorted in Arabic all women, children and aged to leave their houses and to take shelter on the slopes of the hill. By giving this humane warning our fighters threw away the element of complete surprise, and thus increased their own risk in the ensuing battle. A substantial number of the inhabitants obeyed the warning and they were unhurt. A few did not leave their stone houses - perhaps because of the confusion. The fire of the enemy was murderous - to which the number of our casualties bears eloquent testimony. Our men were compelled to fight for every house; to overcome the enemy they used large numbers of hand grenades. And the civilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered inevitable casualties. "The education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years of revolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war. We never broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us, in accordance with the accepted custom of war, to apply reprisals. I am convinced, too, that our officers and men wished to avoid a single unnecessary casualty in the Dir Yassin battle. But those who throw stones of denunciation at the conquerors of Dir Yassin [1] would do well not to don the cloak of hypocrisy [2]. "In connection with the capture of Dir Yassin the Jewish Agency found it necessary to send a letter of apology to Abdullah, whom Mr. Ben Gurion, at a moment of great political emotion, called 'the wise ruler who seeks the good of his people and this country.' The 'wise ruler,' whose mercenary forces demolished Gush Etzion and flung the bodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey, replied with feudal superciliousness. He rejected the apology and replied that the Jews were all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of 'dissidents.' Throughout the Arab world and the world at large a wave of lying propaganda was let loose about 'Jewish attrocities.' "The enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name. In the result it helped us. Panic overwhelmed the Arabs of Eretz Israel. Kolonia village, which had previously repulsed every attack of the Haganah, was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting. Beit-Iksa was also evacuated. These two places overlooked the main road; and their fall, together with the capture of Kastel by the Haganah, made it possible to keep open the road to Jerusalem. In the rest of the country, too, the Arabs began to flee in terror, even before they clashed with Jewish forces. Not what happened at Dir Yassin, but what was invented about Dir Yassin, helped to carve the way to our decisive victories on the battlefield. The legend of Dir Yassin helped us in particular in the saving of Tiberias and the conquest of Haifa." [1] (A footnote from _The Revolt_, pp.226-7.) "To counteract the loss of Dir yassin, a village of strategic importance, Arab headquarters at Ramallah broadcast a crude atrocity story, alleging a massacre by Irgun troops of women and children in the village. Certain Jewish officials, fearing the Irgun men as political rivals, seized upon this Arab gruel propaganda to smear the Irgun. An eminent Rabbi was induced to reprimand the Irgun before he had time to sift the truth. Out of evil, however, good came. This Arab propaganda spread a legend of terror amongst Arabs and Arab troops, who were seized with panic at the mention of Irgun soldiers. The legend was worth half a dozen battalions to the forces of Israel. The `Dir Yassin Massacre' lie is still propagated by Jew-haters all over the world."

Nf-ID: #N:cdp:1483500355:000:10647 Zionism and the Holocaust -------------------------- by Haim Bresheeth The first point to note regarding the appropriation of the history of the Holocaust by Zionist propaganda is that Zionism without anti-semitism is impossible. Zionism agrees with the basic tenet of anti-Semitism, namely that Jews cannot live with non- Jews. The history and roots of the Holocaust go back a long way. While the industru of death and destruction did not operate before 1942, its roots were firmly placed in the 19th Century. Jewish aspirations for emancipation emerged out of the national struggles in Europe. When the hopes for liberation through bourgeois-democratic change were dashed, other alternatives for improving the lot of the Jews of Europe achieved prominence. The socialist Bund, a mass movement with enormous following, had to contend with opposition from a new and small, almost insignificant opponent, the political Zionists. In outline these two offered diametrically opposed options for Jews in Europe. While the Bund was suggesting joining forces with the rest of Europe's workers, the Zionists were proposing a new programme aimed at ridding Europe of its Jews by setting up some form of a Jewish state. Historically, nothing is inevitable, all depends on the balance of forces involved in the struggle. History can be seen as an option tree: every time a certain option is chosen, other routes become barred. Because of that choice, movement backwards to the point before that choice was made is impossible. While Zionism as an option was taken by many young Jews, it remained a minority position until the first days of the 3rd Reich. The Zionist Federation of Germany (ZVfD), an organisation representing a tiny minority of German Jews, was selected by the Nazis as the body to represent the Jews of the Reich. Its was the only flag of an interantional organisation allowed to fly in Berlin, and this was the only international organisation allowed to operate during this period. From a marginal position, the leaders of the Zionist Federation were propelled to a prominence and centrality that surprised even them. All of a sudden they attained political power, power based not on representation, but from being selected as the choice of the Nazi regime for dealing with the the 'Jewish problem'. Their position in negotiating with the Nazis agreements that affected the lives of many tens of thousands of the Jews in Germany transformed them from a utopian, marginal organisation in Germany (and some other countries in Europe) into a real option to be considered by German Jews. The best example of this was the 'Transfer Agreement' of 1934. Immediately after the Nazi takeover in 1933, Jews all over the world supported or were organising a world wide boycott of German goods. This campaign hurt the Nazi regime and the German authorities searched frantically for a way disabling the boycott. It was clear that if Jews and Jewish organisations were to pull out, the campaign would collapse. This problem was solved by the ZVfD. A letter sent to the Nazi party as early as 21. June 1933, outlined the degree of agreement that existed between the two organisations on the question of race, nation, and the nature of the 'Jewish problem', and it offered to collaborate with the new regime: "The realisation of Zionism could only be hurt by resentment of Jews abroad against the German development. Boycott propaganda - such as is currently being carried out against Germany in many ways - is in essence unZionist, because Zionism wants not to do battle but to convince and build." In their eagerness to gain credence and the backing of the new regime, the Zionist organisation managed to undermine the boycott. The main public act was the signature of the "Transfer Agreement" with the Nazi authorities during the Zionist Congress of 1934. In essence, the agreement was designed to get Germany's Jews out of the country and into Mandate Palestine. It provided a possibility for Jews to take a sizeable part of their property out of the country, through a transfer of German goods to Palestine. This right was denied to Jews leaving to any other destination. The Zionist organisation was the acting agent, through its financial organisations. This agreement operated on a number of fronts - 'helping' Jews to leave the country, breaking the ring of the boycott, exporting German goods in large quantities to Palestine, and last but not least, enabling the regime to be seen as humane and reasonable even towards its avowed enemies, the Jews. After all, they argued, the Jews do not belong in Europe and now the Jews come and agree with them. After news of the agreement broke, the boycott was doomed. If the Zionist Organization found it possible and necessary to deal with the Nazis, and import their goods, who could argue for a boycott ? This was not the first time that the interests of both movements were presented to the German public as complementary. Baron Von Mildenstein, the first head of the Jewish Department of the SS, later followed by Eichmann, was invited to travel to Palestine. This he did in early 1933, in the company of a Zionist leader, Kurt Tuchler. Having spent six months in Palestine, he wrote a series of favourable articles in Der STURMER describing the 'new Jew' of Zionism, a Jew Nazis could accept and understand. This little-known episode established quite clearly the relationship during the early days of Nazism, between the new regime and the ZVfD, a relationship that was echoed later in a number of key instances, even after the nature of the Final Solution became clear. In many cases this meant a silencing of reports about the horrors of the exterminations. A book concentrating on this aspect of the Zionist reaction to the Holocaust is Post-Ugandan Zionism in the Crucible of the Holocaust, by S. B. Beth-Zvi. In the case of the Kastner episode, around which Jim Allen's play PERDITION is based, even the normal excuse of lack of knowledge of the real nature of events does not exist. It occured near the end of the war. The USSR had advanced almost up to Germany. Italy and the African bases had been lost. The Nazis were on the run, with a number of key countries, such as Rumania, leaving the Axis. A second front was a matter of months away, as the western Allies prepared their forces. In the midst of all this we find Eichmann, the master bureaucrat of industrial murder, setting up his HZ in occupied Budapest, after the German takeover of the country in April 1944. His first act was to have a conference with the Jewish leadership, and to appoint Zionist Federation members, headed by Kastner as the agent and clearing house for all Jews and their relationship with the SS and the Nazr authorities. Why they did this is not difficult to see. As opposed to Poland, where its three and a half million Jews lived in ghettoes and were visibly different from the rest of the Polish population, the Hungarian Jews were an integrated part of the community. The middle class was mainly Jewish, the Jews were mainly middle-class. They enjoyed freedom of travel, served in the Hungarian (fascist) army in fronline units, as officers and soldiers, their names were Hungarian - how was Eichmann to find them if they were to be exterminated ? The task was not easy, there were a million Jews in Hungary, most of them resident, the rest being refugees from other countries. Many had heard about the fate of Jews elsewhere, and were unlikely to believe any statements by Nazi officials. Like elsewhere, the only people who had the information and the ear of the frightened Jewish population were the Judenrat. In this case the Judenrat comprsied mainly the Zionist Federation members. Without their help the SS, with 19 officers and less than 90 men, plus a few hundred Hungarian police, could not have collected and controlled a million Jews, when they did not even know their whereabouts. Kastner and the others were left under no illusions. Eichmann told Joel Brand, one of the members of Kastner's committee, that he intended to send all Hungary's Jews to Auschwitz, before he even started the expulsions! He told them clearly that all these Jews will die, 12,000 a day, unless certain conditions were met. The Committee faced a simple choice - to tell the Jews of Hungary about their fate, (with neutral Rumania, where many could escape, being in most cases a few hours away) or to collaborate with the Nazis by assisting in the concentration process. What would not have been believed when coming from the SS, sounded quite plausible when coming from the mouths of the Zionist leadership. Thus it is, that most of the Hungarian Jews went quietly to their death, assured by their leadership that they were to be sent to work camps. To be sure, there are thirty pieces of silver in this narrative of destruction: the trains of 'prominents' which Eichmann promised to Kastner - a promise he kept to the last detail. For Eichmann it was a bargain: allowing 1,680 Jews to survive, as the price paid for the silent collaboration over the death of almost a million Jews. There was no way in which the Jews of Hungary could even be located, not to say murdered, without the full collaboration of Kastner and his few friends. No doubt the SS would hunt a few Jews here and there, but the scale of the operation would have been miniscule compared to the half million who died in Auschwitz. It is important to realise that Kastner was not an aberration, like say Rumkovsky in Lodz. Kastner acted as a result of his strongly held Zionist convictions. His actions were a logical outcome of earlier positions. This is instanced when he exposed to the Gestapo the existence of a British cell of saboteurs, Palgi and Senesh, and persuaded them to give themselves up, so as not to disrupt his operations. At no point during his trial or elsewhere, did Kastner deny that he knew exactly what was to happen to those Jews. To conclude, the role played by Zionists in this period, was connected to another role they could, and should have played, that of alarming the whole world to what was happening in Europe. They had the information, but politically it was contrary to their priorities. The priorities were, and still are, quite simple: All that furthers the Zionist enterprise in Palestine is followed, whatever the price. The lives of individuals, Jews and non-Jews, are secondary. If this process requires dealing with fascists, Nazis and other assorted dictatorial regimes across the world, so be it.

I am sick and tired of this 'DRIVING THE JEWS INTO THE SEA' sentance attributed to Islamic movements and the PLO; it simply can't be proven as part of their plan ! (Pro Israeli activists repeat it like parrots without checking its authenticity since it was coined by Bnai Brith) What Hamas and Islamic Jihad believe in, as far as I can get from the Arab media, is an Islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under Koranic Law. This would be a reversal of the 1948 situation in which the Jews in Palestine took control of the land and its (mostly Muslim) inhabitants. However, whoever committed crimes against humanity (torture, blowing up their homes, murders,...) must be treated and tried as a war criminal. The political thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice. As for the PLO, I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat's mind. Although their political thinking seems far fetched with Israel acting as a true super-power in the region, the Islamic movements are using the same weapon the Jews used to establish their state : Religion. Ahmed. Forget the syntax, Ahmed, and focus on the semnatics. The fact is that the PLO does not recognize Israel's right to exist. This is perfectly obvious from the PLO covenant (Cairo, 1968). The covenant calls for the destruction of the "Zionist entity". As far as I know the Israel-destruction clauses still exist in the document which specifies the purpose for the existence of the PLO. If you would like, I can post the relevant caluses. Now the Hamas ideal is far more radical, it seems. I know it has been posted here several times, and while I do not have a copy of it, I am sure that someone does and he (or she, of course) would be more than happy to repost it. Regardless of phrasing, groups like Hamas, and the Hezbollah, and even the newly moderate and politically-correct PLO, have at the very heart of their ideologies the need for the destrcution of Israel. It just seems to me that Mr. Davidsson's suggestion that Jews support people envolved in these organizations is not a particularly appealing one to many Jews. Harry.

It seems to me that you are the one who is supposed to do some reading. I think that our major difference in opinion is on the legitimacy of Sevres. First, thattreaty was signed by the Ottoman Empire therefore legally it does not bind the Republic of Turkey. The new independence movement (which by the way, is not the same as the Young Turks) naturally rejected it out of hand. to say that we should accept because the Germans did theirs is absurd. We saw what the cosequences of such harsh treaties were in Hitler. Second, the Sevres treaty was even worse than Versailles. It divided the Ottoman Empire in to several influence zones, had the capital occupied, the economy under Allied control, the army di minished to nothing but a police force, in short a country in name only. I'd wonder if you would like to live under such conditions. And for the record, I donot feel sorry for the soldiers killed in IZMIR harbour. Before evacuating the city, the Greek forces burned it down, so it serves them right. As for being fooled by Allied promises, that too is your fault. You did not come to Anatolia just to enforce Sevres but to take part in the plunder as well. K. Burak Ucer -

In other words, they were telling a pesky reporter to keep guessing. Israel maintains this same attitude about nuclear weapons it may or may not have. The US maintains the same attitude about the presence of nuclear weapons on specific naval craft. By refusing to acknowledge the existence of such weapons on specific ships, US warships have, I believe, become unwelcome in New Zealand, which has declared itself a nuclear-free-zone. >The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years >there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to >long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the >crimes of which they were accused ever being made public.

It would've been more convincing if your reporter had come up with just one name of someone who is sitting in jail, lost to the world, as he suggests. Maybe Elvis, or JFK, somebody. Let's put it this way: If Israel has put people away without publicizing their arrests or the legal proceedings against them, how has their disappearance been explained? People have relatives, friends and colleagues, you know. Israel is not known as a place where people are made to vanish. Would you care to give us a list of people whose whereabouts are unknown?

Later in the day I then proceed with refilling the engine oil. It's just crazy how I try and change the oil on my cars in one weekend---I go through about 3 bottles of Tylenol and 2 bags of ice. John

G'day people, Are there any MR2 owners or motor-head gurus out there, that know why my MR2's engine sounds noisy? The MR2's engine is noisy at the best of times, but not even a nice nose - it's one of those very ugly noises. I do an oil change every 2-3 months, and for about 2 months the engine noise sounds relatively quiet during driving and idling. At around the 3 month mark, after an oil change (I've been tracking this very thoroughly for months now) it starts to get that very disgusting noise, not so much during driving, but more so during idling. What's its problem? Also.. I don't know if it's just me, but if noticed a little performance drop. It just hasn't got the acceleration it used to. Any help/tips would be appreciated!! Worried.
I have a '71 Buick Skylark with 148K on it. I bought it in California, and if it'll let me, I'd like to keep it for another year. The only problem is these Indiana winters--my heater controls don't work. The car has vacuum operated control switches for the vents. Right now it is stuck in the "vent" mode. It will blow warm air, but I can't switch the air flow to either the floor (I can live without this) or the defrost (I can't live without this). I probably could just jam the air deflector to the defrost position, but this blows a lot of air in my face and is, well, kind of like putting a vacuum cleaner in reverse. I have taken parts of the dash off and looked at the vacuum system and I think the problem (or part of it) is with the two diaphragms which control up/down and outside/inside air flow. THe diaphragm which controls outside(vent)/in- side(no vent) air is cracked most of the way around, and the other one is probably damaged too, considering the advanced age of the car. Two questions: 1) Is there anything I should be aware of about this (other than the fact that I should move from Indiana) ? 2) In the event that replacement diaphragms aren't available, is there a way to "fix" this? THanks for any advice/info selah, Dan lovall@physics.purdue.edu
I had the exactly same problem with my '70 Lesabre. It was also from Cal. What I did was go to the local junkyard and pick up a diaphragm from a '68 Lesabre with the same heater set up. It worked for me, but a little bit slow to change from vents to defogger. Better than nothing!
A while back I asked for help in defending a traffic ticket I received. In short: The ticket was for not stopping at a stop sign. Given the conditions I could not stop in time and decided instead of sliding right through the intersection, I would complete my right-turn and avoid a possible accident. A police cruiser happened to be approaching the intersection from my left and gave me the ticket. The officer said "The only reason that you even slowed down in the first place was that you saw me approaching, otherwise you would have bombed right through" I would like to thank all those who responded favorably to my request for help. To all of those who told me to bite the bullet and pay the fine: PHGHGHGHGH.. The judge sided with me and decided that in this case "Not stopping" was the safest thing to do and found me NOT GUILTY. The officer's statement and my account of the conditions at the time (very slippery, backed by newpaper weather conditions) were the factors what made the judge decide on his verdict. Moral: If you have never been to court before and you think you have a case, go for it. It is a very interesting process, and it is there for your benefit. Exercise your rights.

-- My boss is interested in a new 300 series Mercedes Benz wagon. Does anyone have any testimonial evidence and/or strong opinions on this car (or line)? Particularly, I would like to hear about power (manual t. only) reliability, feel, and any unusually good or bad features of the line. She currently drives a VW Passat, and is being plagued by its electrical problems. The dealer claims there is nothing wrong, even though the doors have a habit of locking and unlocking them- selves while you are driving down the road. The automatic shoulder restraints also like to move back and forth as you move along. She does not have the new, larger engine and is quite dissatisfied with its lack of power. The MB wagon would have to have more power and no peculiar problems such as the Passat's electrical system. She is also considering a Saab 9000 (add some letters). Any comparisons between the 9000 line and the Mercedes would be helpful. Price is not an impediment. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jeremy J.

A lot of people put higher priorities on gas mileage and cost than on safety, buying "unsafe" econoboxes instead of Volvos.

I figure that 30mph collisions into brick walls aren't common enough for me to spend that much extra money for protection, but there are lots of low-speed collisions that do worry me. jim frost jimf@centerline.com

Depending on how you plan to use your SUV, I might recommend also browsing Trailer Boats and one or more of those Pickup, Shotgun, and 4WD magazines. The car rags mostly seem to consider recently graded pea gravel to be offroading and ten sacks of redwood chips to be a bedload. Considering that most of these SUVs seem to be used mostly as robust station wagons, that's probably not a bad approach, but if your applications are more demanding, pick your information sources accordingly. Of the three vehicles on your short list (Explorer, 4Runner, Pathfinder), I'd recommend the 4Runner as being closely based on a rather robust pickup and the Explorer for being comfortably carlike. Don't know much about the Pathfinder. Good luck, --Joe "Just another personal opinion from the People's Republic of Berkeley"

Hi, maybe someone can help me here... I am looking to buy this 1990 Nissan Maxima GXE for CDN$14000 right now. The car has 96000 km (or about 60000 miles) on it. A typical mileage for 1990 cars seem to be about 70000 km (or about 43K mi). The seller just informed me that when he brought the car in for certification he was told that the front break pads and the exhausts had to be replaced to meet the legal standards. (He said he will replace the components before selling the car to me.) Being copmletely ignorant to the technical stuff on cars, I don't know what this could mean... Is 96K km about the time typical for replacing the above mentioned items? Or is this an indication that the car was abused? Would other things break down or have to be replaced soon? The seller told me that he used the car on the highway a lot, but, I don't know how to verify this... I've seen the paint chipped away in tiny dots in the front edge of the hood, though. Although the Maxima is an excellent car and the car is very clean and well kept, it's currently out of warranty (a similarly priced '90 Accord with 70K km will have 2 years or 30K km worth of warranty left) and I don't want to worry about paying for any repair bills... But, I also need a car for 5 people... When will the new Maxima come out, by the way? I would very much appreciate your input in this. Please reply by e-mail (preferred) or post in this newsgroup.

It's great that all these other cars can out-handle, out-corner, and out- accelerate an Integra. But, you've got to ask yourself one question: do all these other cars have a moonroof with a sliding sunshade? No wimpy pop-up sunroofs or power sliding roofs that are opaque. A moonroof that can be opened to the air, closed to let just light in, or shaded so that nothing comes in. You've just got to know what's important :^). -Doug '93 Integra GS

This seems to be a popular scam with dealers. Last month my brother bought a new Audi 90 series quatro from a local dealer. They came back with the final price, tax and all, and he added it up for himself. There happened to be an extra $300 tagged on under the tax part. He pointed out their error and asked them to re-think their addition. They came back with the right price the next time.
Thanks to everyone who responded to my Honda Accord break question. It does seem that the master cylinder is bad. I will have my mechanic double check and be sure it isn't something simpler and cheaper first, but from your responses it sounds like it is very likely to be the master cylinder. Thanks everyone!!

Hello netters! I'm visiting the US (I'm from Sweden) in August. I will probably rent a Chevy Beretta from Alamo. I've been quoted $225 for a week/ $54 for additional days. This would include free driving distance, but not local taxes (Baltimore). They also told me all insurance thats necessary is included, but I doubt that, 'cause a friend rented a car last year and it turned out he needed a lot more insurance than what's included in the base price. But on the other hand he didn't rent it from Alamo. Does anyone have some info on this? Is $225 a rip-off? Probability that I'll be needing more insurance? Is the beretta a good rental car? Thanx Markus
I'd like to converse with anyone who has purchased a 1993 Honda Civic about their experience. I'm new to the car buying game and would like to know what price I can expect to pay for a sedan after bargaining. Thanks in advance, -- Ellen

I was wondering if anyone out in net-land have any opinions on MGs in general. I know they are not the most reliable cars around but summer is approaching and they are convertibles `8^). I'm interested in a 75 MG but any opinions on MGs would be appreciated. Thanks.

They have a streak of meanness that runs much deeper and stronger than anything I ever experienced even during the height of the 60's racial struggles. I am absolutely convinced that there are kids out there today that have no concept of right and wrong, but have the human intelligence which is turning them into the greatest predators that have ever walked the earth. They will prevail unless the rest of humanity decides that it is in their best interest to stand up against these feral humans, and for individuals to start taking some responsibility for their own protection. In a state in which the individuals turn to the authorities and police for protection, the police and government is soon composed of the very feral humans that they originally sought protection from.

HELP!!! my wife has informed me that she wants a convertible for her next car. We live in South Fla., so we are definitely in the right are for one. My wife has mentioned the Miata, but I think it is too small. I would like to wait for the new Mustangs ( Dec. '93 I think). Anyone have any opinions on any/all convertibles in a reasonable price range. Thanx

While I don't read normally read this group, I was looking for Valentine radar information (sigh, maybe in the FAQ) and came across your posting.. I bought a '93 Probe GT with the PEP 263A last July (now at 9500 miles) after debating over the Sentra SE-R/NX2000, MX6, MR-2, Stealth, Prelude, and Celica. Check this month's Consumer Reports for previous Probe records. My criteria: a "fun" car with ABS, airbag, over 130hp, and less than $25K. I thought about a turbo, but checking with insurance people ruled that out. The Tri-Star cars (Eclipse/Talon/etc) were out since they don't have an air bag. Ditto for the Mustang(also no ABS). The SE-R/NX2000/M20 fell into the pocket-rocket category. A good used car buy. The MX-6 was almost there but rolled more than I liked. I didn't like the Prelude dash/instrumentation at all. Too weird for me. The MR2 has a much smaller non-passenger space than I needed, so out that went. The Celica was "ok" but underpowered when loaded with options (and somewhat overpriced too) in non-turbo form. I never considered the 240SX since it didn't have an airbag. I did look at it for its RWD virtues but that's it. The Corolla never entered my mind. I should have looked at the Mitsubishi VR4/Dodge Stealth more. Since my list was exhausted, I bought the Probe. :-) The car design is different than earlier years, so it's too early to see its reliability so far. For what it's worth, my comments: My dislikes: Shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal. Headlights have "stuck" up a few times (weather?) air conditioning broke ~4000 miles (pressure cycling switch) condensation around rear washer fluid container doesn't drain completely. crammed engine; little hope for do-it-yourselfers (typical) parts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford parts underside plastic doesn't like sharp driveways and speedbumps (typical). assembly gripes: tape on radiator, screw fell out of dash, seat seams not stitched properly. Hopefully just a fluke. Ford only gives 1 key with the car. C'mon Ford, spend an extra few pennies! Rear hatch has no padding on corners when up. I'm waiting for the day when I bash my head on the corner. horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference) Tires fling dirt/mud onto side of car My Likes: engine (design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque) -- definitely #1 handling (very good for FWD; understeer only at limits) transmission (the 5 speed is a must) usable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere) Very little torque steer at full power (much better than the '90 SHO I drive) stability at 100+mph (high gearing though) low cowl (good visibility in front) Heated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather) ABS/Air bag (see above) rear seats fold down (I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important) No shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!) Tires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-) As you can see, I'm primarily interested in the engine. While it doesn't have the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big selling point for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine. The overall car is a good buy for the money. That market segment hasn't changed much since July (Prelude VTEC, Honda Del Sol??). I drive it to and from work each day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that the Probe's suspension doesn't like potholes. When you test drive one, find a potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable. If you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too. They'll find that they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car rides differently (if that's "better" is up to you). Also, there's a lot of glass around you which I wasn't expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty hot in the summer. My back seat passengers (now very few) complain about the lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined with the heat. I've heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine. Leather and the keyless entry system weren't available when I got the car so I can't comment on them (I got the car before it was officially announced). I prefer cloth to leather anyway. I wouldn't want this car in the snow: The suspension is too rough for the inevitable surprise potholes, tires aren't meant for snow, and the seats assume that you're not wearing lots of thick clothing. Rain is much better: water generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper controls are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with the Eagles (and I was really trying). There is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places. The GT has map holders below the speakers in the door, but they're rigid plastic that could fit two cassettes or CD's max. The center console/storage bin/arm rest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth "pouch" but that's it. No change holders. Quite a let-down from the SHO. And the Probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car! Lastly, don't store wet car covers in the back. The foam will soak the water up and the result will *not* smell pleasant :-(.

I just had my 41 Chrysler painted. I was told to refrain from waxing it and to leave it out in the sun!! Supposedly this let's the volatiles escape from the paint over a month or so (I can smell it 15 feet away on a hot day) and lets any slight irregularites in the surface flow out, as the paint remains a little soft for a while.

I had exactly the same problem with a 1981 Horizon. Third gear would just disengage. Engine would rev up. Kind of disconcerting. I sold that car quite a few years back but the memory of that tranny sticks with me. It also had a clutch chatter in first that the dealer could not fix. If the lemon law had been in place then, that car would have been covered. I have had several Jap cars since then (figuring the Horizon was my contribution to the American Auto Companies), and have never seen any bad behavior with the exception of a Toyota Tercel with a bit of clutch chatter that they did fix on the first try. Anyway, from that day forward, I have sworn that I would never purchase another American car with a standard. American manufacturers don't have a clue on how to manufacture five speed transmissions and have been doing the automatics much longer and on many more cars. However, I hate automatics, so I am still buying Jap cars. Not sure this is any help, but other cars do this too.

This suggestion isn't as far-fetched as it sounds. Years ago in another time and place, I used to do oil changes in boats powered by automotive engines. In many cases, there was no way to get any sort of a tray under the oil pan because it was boxed in by the bottom of the hull and various floation chambers on each side. And if you *did* get something there, you'd spill all the oil out of it for sure trying to get it back out again. So we used a small pump powered by an electric drill to suck the oil out the dipstick hole. There was a long/thin hose on the inlet side designed to fit down the dipstick tube, and another, thicker/shorter hose on the outlet side that you put into any convenient container. I'm sure these gadgets are still available from marine hardware suppliers if you want one. Mart L.

We're considering getting a Ford Explorer XLT with 4WD and we have the following questions (All we would do is go skiing -- no off-roading): 1. With 4WD, do we need the "performance axle" - (limited slip axle). Its purpose is to allow the tires to act independently when the tires are on different terrain. 2. Do we need the all-terrain tires (P235/75X15) or will the all-season (P225/70X15) be good enough for us at Lake Tahoe?

My 1988 Toyota 4Runner has a rolldown rear window with a keylock switch. It sticky on me. Yesterday it was tough to get the key to work and it also happened to stick on in the up direction so the stalled motor was powered all night killing the battery. I'd like to try to lubricate the lock switch. What should I lubricate the lock with? email please, thanx, Ken. -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- "Don't drink American corporate swill.

[this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly asked automotive questions; the other article contains questions more geared to the automotive enthusiast, and so is not crossposted to misc.consumers. -- rpw] [changes as of 14 April 1993: revised brake fluid section, as non-silicone DOT-5 fluids are now apparently available -- rpw] Commonly Asked Automotive Questions Tire Questions: Q: What do the funny numbers on the sides of my tires mean? A: Typically, you will see something like 195/60HR14. the 195 is the overall width of the tire in millimeters, the tread is usually narrower. The 60 is the `aspect ratio'; it indicates the height of the sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width. Our example tire has a sidewall height of 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm. The 14 is the wheel diameter in inches; there are also some special tires called `TRX' tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations, like 390, which is in millimeters. The R means Radial, and the H is a speed rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire, when properly inflated and carrying an appropriate load, may safely operate. Common speed ratings are S (112MPH), T (118MPH), H (130MPH), and V (up to 150MPH.) Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed rating to a different part of the designation; you may therefore find designations like 195/60R14 85H; the 85 indicates the per-tire load associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice. What follows is a table showing a number of `load indices' and corresponding maximum per-tire loads: Load Index 50 51 88 89 112 113 145 149 157 Max Load (Kg) 190 195 560 580 1120 1150 2900 3250 4125 Note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table. In some cases, the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire size; the LT designation indicates Light Truck, and the P designation indicates Passenger car. If no letter is given, then the application of the tire is Passenger car usage. As far as I know, these letters only appear in the US market. The LT designation is prinicipally of interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles. For the owner of a passenger vehicle, there is no meaningful difference between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at all. If the aspect ratio is omitted, it is probably 80, but may be 78. Tires with an MS (mud/snow) designation may have their speed rating reduced by 20 km/h (about 12mph.) There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature, traction, and treadwear. Temperature and Traction are graded A, B, and C (with A the best and C the worst); treadwear is a numeric rating. These values are of limited value, as they are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires. Q: My car has tires with a funny size designation: 185/65HR390; can i put normal tires on the car? A: Your tires are called TRX tires; they were devised by Michelin. Because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible with normal tires; Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel (and so that more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels.) You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels, and horribly dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner, or possibly blow out at high speed.) TRX type tires are becoming hard to find; in addition to Michelin, Avon makes suitable tires. Goodyear has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires. Q: Can I rotate radials from side to side, or rotate them only on one side of my car? A: Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject; many say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a car is now ok (this group includes Michelin and Goodyear); others (for example, Pirelli and Nokia) will void warranties if such swapping is done. The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before rotating your tires, and stick to the manufacturer's recommendations. Q: How many snow tires should I buy, and if I buy 2, which end of the car should I put them on? A: In short, 4, and both ends. To explain, many drivers in areas that don't get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively (or at all) in snow conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice. With a rear wheel drive car, you can choose between being able to start the car going (a function of the rear axle) or stopping and turning the car (a function of the front axle.) In a front wheel drive car, you start, stop, and turn with the front end. The primary risk of putting the snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes while going downhill, you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards. Radar Detectors and Speed Limits: Q: Why aren't there any comments on Radar Detectors and Speed Limits in this Q&A posting? A: Because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between misc.consumers and rec.autos.* always start long, tedious, and pointless flame wars. If you want to talk about either of these topics, please subscribe to rec.autos or alt.flame and keep it there. Safety Equipment: Q: Do airbags really work? A: Preliminary statistics suggest the following: Airbags work much better than no belts; good 3 point belts alone work much better than Airbags alone, and AirBags + 3 point belts work slightly better than 3 point belts alone. The con to airbags is that some designs tend to burn the driver's hands when venting the byproducts of the explosion that occurs inside the bag, and that some designs (but not all) may knock the driver's hands from the wheel, making retention of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult. Brake Questions: Q: Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned? Midas always wants to do this. A: No. There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing rotors; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors more often than is strictly necessary. if the rotors are not warped warped, and only lightly grooved, then there is no need to replace or to turn them. Note also that some rotors (the rotors on many Hondas are a good example) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical to turn them; they must be replaced when they become too thin, warped, or badly grooved. Q: They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car down. Is this really a good idea? A: It used to be a very good idea, back in the days of mediocre, fade prone drum brakes. In modern disc brake equipped cars, use of downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary, except in cases of long, steep downhill runs. Otherwise, modern disc brakes are more than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances, and they are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings. On the other hand, many standard driver's license tests in the USA still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking; I suggest that before taking a US driver's test, you either 1) learn to do this smoothly (which takes some time and practice) or 2) borrow a car with an automatic to take the test. Q: How often should I replace my brake fluid? A: Probably more often than you do. Traditional brake fluids tend to absorb water; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid. DOT-3 type are older fluids; DOT-4 and DOT-5 are newer specifications. The principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points; the dry boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid, but the wet boiling point is important in older brake fluid. DOT-3 fluids have the lowest wet and dry boiling point _requirements_; DOT-4 fluids have better boiling point requirements; and DOT-5 fluids have the best boiling point requirements (but DOT-5 fluids are not clearly superior; see the next Q&A for more details.) While the requirements imply that DOT-4 fluids are better than DOT-3 fluids, there may be specific cases where a DOT-3 fluid is preferable, but these are mostly competition applications. Otherwise, DOT-4 type fluids offer _much_ improved brake pedal feel. Replacement once a year is recommended for DOT-4 fluids, although agressive drivers may profit by changing out fluid more frequently, or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid out of the brake calipers fairly regularly. Q: What about DOT-5 brake fluids? A: This breaks down in to two parts. The DOT-5 specification looks excellent for performance, but the first DOT-5 fluids were Silicone based. Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition. Unlike DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, they do not absorb water at all. While this may sound like a feature, the problem is that any water present pools up in such systems, interfering with braking performance and corroding any metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring. The water will tend to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers, where most of the corrosion occurs. Because of this phenomenon, it is essential when converting to Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly beforehand; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the brake system when converting to Silicone fluids. Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids: 1) they are difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles), which interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and 2) while they generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4 fluids, they do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable in effect from boiling DOT-4 fluids. SIlicone fluids may make sense in some street car applications, but they are certainly not recommended for high performance driving applications, and the economics are questionable for street use. I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard that do not contain Silicones; these fluids appear to be reasonably compatible with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, but I have little information at this time. Q: ABS is available on some of the cars I'm looking at, but it costs more. Is it worth it? A: This does not have a cut and dried answer; therefore, this answer will be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons. The short answer is that ABS costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally work better for the `average driver' (that is to say, a driver who does not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques), and may require the `unlearning' of some obsolete braking techniques like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case. Now for the long answer. ABS works by monitering the wheels of the car, looking for signs of locked brakes. It may or may not be able be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several systems on the market.) It cannot detect impending lockup (which is what you would really want in an ideal world), but only the existence of lockup. The sensors used vary; some of the less well designed sensors are sensitive to tire size, and to brake pad material, and may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original equipment or OE-equivalent components. When the sensors detect lockup, the ABS system responds by unlocking the brakes (either individually, or all at once, depending on the system.) If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted, the ABS will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states (if a sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_, then we could sit right at that point, which is where maximum braking effect is achieved.) This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal, as the system cycles. The percentage of the time that the brakes are truly engaged is called the `duty cycle'; typically in an ABS system this is about 40% On dry pavement, a trained driver can beat this duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking; on wet pavement, braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform threshold braking nearly every time. Unfortunately, on mud and on snow, often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes locked; only Audi, of the manufacturers producing ABS-equipped cars, has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this eventuality. A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves steering control. This is the case simply because, if you are braking near the limit and turn the wheel, the ABS will release the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup, and back off on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied. Braking distances will lengthen accordingly. An important caution: ABS cannot exceed the maximum theoretical braking force in any given situation; if you start sliding on glare ice, don't expect an ABS system to help you out very much. The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an ABS system in your car. As far as maintenence goes, in addition to the potential restrictions I've listed above, you have to worry about the following: 1) parts costs are much higher; the OE master cylinder for my obscure european sedan lists for $185, but the OE master cylinder for the ABS-equipped version of the same car lists for over $1000. Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT-5 (silicone) brake fluids in ABS-equipped vehicles. Because of the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system components, regular (I suggest annual) replacement of brake fluid becomes very important. Q: What about this threshold braking business? A: [normally, I'd not put this in the consumers Q&A, but recent publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers in ABS-equipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is needed here -- rpw] Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high performance drivers; if made a habit, it replaces the `stab the pedal and lock 'em up' panic habit entirely, and is much to be prefered. Basically, the premise is that tires generate maximum braking force when they have just started to slide, but just before the wheels lock up entirely. Drivers who threshold brake learn to feel what this `threshold' feels like, and learn to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake pedal. In many cars, you can feel that you are near the threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it. In any case, if you can't hear the tires whine just a bit, you're not very near the threshold. In a car with ABS, often there is a twinge in the pedal just before the system starts cycling; if the driver backs off on the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt, then they are very close to the threshold and they'll probably achieve better stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS take over. Recently, there has been a rash of publicity over a number of accidents, and one death, involving police cars equipped with ABS systems. The police departments in question quickly blamed the new ABS systems, but according to Autoweek magazine, it now seems clear that the problem was a lack of training; none of the involved officers had any recent performance driving training. There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing brake pedal by `pump braking', an old and discredited technique of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal, the goal being to try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system. If you think about it for a minute, you'll realize that pump braking must cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least 1/2, so if you cut the 40% duty cycle of an ABS system by that much, you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason. Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS; if you do fear a failed hydraulic system, then one or two stabs at the pedal will be sufficient. Gas Questions: Q: Does High Octane gasoline help? A: Maybe, maybe not. Some cars have knock sensors, and can adjust the engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used. On most cars, however, you should use the cheapest gas that makes your car run well. Check your owner's manual for details on what your car needs. Q: My car was made for leaded gasoline. Will unleaded gas hurt it? A: It is possible that unleaded gas may *slightly* increase valve wear, although the Amoco Oil company argues otherwise. The actual increase in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable, however, as modern leaded gasolines actually contain very little lead. You should, however, check your owner's manual; many cars from the early 1970s do not actually require leaded gasoline. Q: Do fuel treatments help? What kind should I use? A: Some do and some don't. During the winter, it is a good idea to use dry gas; however, some may be harmful to fuel injection systems. Never use an additive containing Methanol (sometimes called Methyl Alcohol); such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection. Manufacturer's opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol (sometimes called Ethyl Alcohol); if your car has fuel injection, check the owner's manual on your car before using these. Most manufacturers consider 10% Ethanol acceptable in gasoline. Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol (Isopropanol), and Petroleum Distillates are fine in fuel injected cars. An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with fuel injectors, although many premium gasolines contain detergents that do the same job. Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain Ethanol or Methanol; always check the ingredients before putting anything in your gas tank. There are a small number of particularly good additives; these are noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones, but work much, much better. Among these are Chevron Techron, Redline SL-1, Wurth `Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber', and BG 44K. A bottle of one of these, once every six months, is highly recommended. Q: What about detergent gasolines? A: The quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat; BMW has instituted a testing program, and gasoline brands which pass this test may advertise that fact. Stickers indicating passage of the test are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations. If such gasolines are used, then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional. Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean engine clean, they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits. Lubrication Questions: Q: What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean? A: There are several different items encoded. There is a two-letter code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer uses in the oil; this looks like SE,SF,CD or such. The S codes are for gasoline engine applications; the C codes are for diesel engine applications. The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels of protection are developed; thus SF is considered better than SE, SE is considered better than SD, and so forth. The more noticeable designation is the oil weight. This is either a single number (e.g., 30 weight) or a pair of numbers separated by the letter W (e.g., 10W30.) The latter type is much more commonly used these days, and are the only type that most automobile manufacturers specify in operators manuals. The first number in the designation (10W) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold; the W stands for `winter'. The second number (30) is the viscosity of the oil when hot. There is a trick here; the oil doesn't actually get thicker (turn from 10 weight to 30 weight) as it gets hotter. What is actually happening is that when the oil is cold, it has the viscosity of a cold 10 weight oil. as it gets hotter, it doesn't get thin as fast as a 10W oil would; by the time it is up to temperature, it has the viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil. Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities; not all 10W oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold, and not all 30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot. Note also that the novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives, and it has been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX, 10W40 oils do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time. 10W30, 15W40, and 20W50 oils work very well, though. Q: Are `quick lube' places any good? A: Some do adequate work, but there are quite a few incompetent ones out there. Let the buyer beware, watch them while they work, make sure that they don't overtorque the oil drain plug, and keep your hand on your wallet at all times. Q: Are oil additives like Slick-50 or Tufoil any good? A: Slick-50 and Tufoil are PTFE-based additives. Many of these have come onto the market recently; they are different from the moly-based additives that have been around since the early 50's. PTFE is the chemical name for Teflon(TM), a trademark owned by DuPont. In general, auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products. Most USENET responses to questions on these additives are favorable (slight increase of MPG after application, smoother revving) but long term results (whether PTFE additives are effective after 5K miles) are debatable. Some manufacturers (such as Saab) claim that either the product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage. Some BMW owners have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of Slick 50 to their cars. This writer has been cautioned by a Slick-50 Dealer (!) that Slick-50 should _not_ be used in Japanese motors, as it may clog the oil return passages in the engine. Otherwise, there are no known reports of damage caused by PTFE additives. On the other hand, there are satified Slick 50 customers in the world. Q: Do synthetic oils really work? A: Yes, but. More specifically, most auto manufactuers accept synthetics, but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by oil manufacturers. Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your car. Even if you decide to try the longer intervals, at least change the oil filter at regular intervals, as synthetics get just as dirty as conventional oils. Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter entirely; Amsoil, Redline, and AGIP are very highly regarded and very effective. Mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews, however. Q: Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals. How often should I change my oil? A: It depends on how you drive. If your car always (or nearly always) gets warmed up, and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs down, the manufacturer's recommendation is probably fine. If, however, you drive it hard, drive it at high revs, or alternatively, if you only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn't get up to temperature, then you may wish to change oil much more often, perhaps at 3000 mile intervals (given that most manufacturers are now specifying 7500 mile intervals.) If you don't drive your car much at all (say 7500 miles a year), then you probably want to change oil every six months anyway. If you are storing a car during the winter, then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out of storage. Misc. Questions: Q: My car has a timing belt. I hear that bad things happen when they break. What's the story? A: It depends on the internal design of the motor. Early Ford Escorts, for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt. Some Honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be. If no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent replacement. Ask your dealer or independent mechanic. Also, ask if there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time (for example, the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have a timing belt driven water pump, which has been known to seize, destroying the timing belt, and which then causes major valve damage as a side effect. Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water pump can be a costly mistake.) Q: Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it self destructs when the timing belt breaks? A: For performance reasons. Compromising piston design so that the valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression ratio of the engine be reduced significantly; this is why you are more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance oriented vehicles. Q: What causes Unintended Acceleration? A: The final report of the National Highway, Transportation, and Safety Administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the same time be consistent with the physical evidence. The NHTSA report goes on to conclude that `pedal misapplication' by the vehicle operator is probably the cause. -- richard welty 518-393-7228 welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com ``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of a race car about either its pitch or roll axis'' -- Carroll Smith
I have just taken delivery on a new GM car (Firebird) with a clearcoat finish. I assume that it is probably urethane since the industry has moved in that direction in paints. In years past, it used to be recommended that owners wait up to 60 days before you wax a car, for the paint to "cure." The dealer shop manager said this also, but I'm not sure that he wasn't just basing it on past tradition. Does anyone know if this is still a recommended practice, or is it better to go ahead and wax right away (non-abrasive new car wax) with the newer finishes? -- Terry Quinn Germantown Hills, IL tquinn@heartland.bradley.edu from Compuserve . . . >INTERNET: tquinn@heartland.bradley.edu

My sister has an MGB. She has one from the last year they were produced (1978? 1979?). Its in very good shape. I've been bugging her for years about selling it. I've said over and over that she should sell it before the car is worthless while she maintains that the car may actually be increasing in value as a result of its limited availability. Which one of us is right? Are there MGB affectionados out there who are still willing to pay $6K to 8K for an old MG? Are there a lot out in the market? -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Mike Brookbank, |MKS| 35 King St. North mike@mks.com Director, InterOpen Sales, |MKT| Waterloo, Ontario (519)884-2251 Mortice Kern Systems Inc. |MKS| Canada, N2J 2W9 fax (519)884-8861
X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL6] The answer to your question is...sort of. Volkswagen had a much less robust version of this army vehicle out in the early '70's (or thereabouts). It was called the Volskwagen Thing, and was, of course, a convertible. I havent seen many around then or now. Good luck... -Mik

One of the local dealers has a used (7k miles) '93 Probe GT on the lot with a photocopy of a document taped to the window saying the dealership bought the car back from the previous owner because of "Engine noises", but that the Ford district rep had OK'ed the car saying those noises were "normal". I thought it was worth looking into (the car seems otherwise clean) and mentioned this to a co-worker, who proceeded to tell me a horror story about her son's '93 Probe GT, which had several problems, ending with engine noises which she said "was something with the heads", that Ford acknowledged the noise, said they were working on it, but didn't have a cure as of yet. Her son traded the car in (and I checked -- not the same car). So I have some evidence of a reoccuring problem with the V6 in the Probe GT's, and by extension with the Madza 626 and MX-6. Anything to this? I'd love to consider buying the GT (I'm turning 40 -- time for my scheduled mid life crisis :-) but I'd hate to find out I just became the proud owner of a Lemon.
I have a 1986 Acura Integra 5 speed with 95,000 miles on it. It is positively the worst car I have ever owned. I had an 83 Prelude that had 160k miles on it when I sold it, and it was still going strong . This is with religious attention to maintenance such as oil changes etc. Both cars were driven in exactly the same manner.. 1. It has gone through two clutches (which are underrated.) 2. 3 sets of tires (really eats tires in the front even with careful align) 3. All struts started leaking about 25-30k miles 4. Windshield wiper motor burned up (service note on this one) 5. Seek stop working on radio about 20k miles 6. Two timing belts. 7. Constant error signals from computer. 8. And finally. A rod bearing went out on the No. 1 piston seriously damaging the crankshaft, contaminating the engine etc. When the overhaul was done last week it required new crankshaft, one new cam shaft (has two) because the camshaft shattered when they tried to mill it. The camshaft took 4 weeks to get because it is on national back order. Everything on the engine is unique to the 1986 year. They went to a new design in 87. Parts are very expensive. No way would I ever buy another Acura. It is highly overrated. .
[most recent changes, 15 March 1993: addition of alt.autos.karting -- rpw] === Welcome to Rec.Autos.* === This article is sent out automatically each month, and contains a general description of the purpose of each of the automotive newsgroups, and some suggested guidelines for discussions. The keywords `Monthly Posting' will always appear to make killing this article easy for users of newsreaders with kill facilities. This article is posted to all autos groups, but followups are directed only to rec.autos. If you don't understand what this means, ask your system administrator for help, or at least for copies of the newuser documentation. Failing that, please subscribe to the newsgroup news.announce.newusers and read the documentation provided there. Introduction to the Rec.Autos newsgroup hierarchy: rec.autos.tech is intended for technical discussions of automobiles, their design, construction, diagnosis, and service. Other discussions are largely inappropriate, especially For Sale ads. rec.autos.sport is intended for discussion of legal, organized competition involving automobiles. Technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply to competition vehicles. Discussion from either of two viewpoints, spectator and participant, is encouraged. Arguments about sports cars are largely inappropriate, as are most other discussions. For Sale ads are inappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles and/or equipment. Discussions of illegal events are marginal; one should probably avoid advocating breaking the law. (remember, the FBI reads Usenet!) rec.autos.driving is intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles. Also, if you must discuss 55 vs. 65, or radar detectors, or <insert your pet driving peeve> boneheads, do it here. rec.autos.vw is intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership of automobiles manufactured by Volkswagen (this includes VWs, Audis, Seats, etc.) It was created on the grounds that the info-vw mailing list was very successful. It should not be presumed from the existence of this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many different marques; groups specific to individual marques should only be created on demonstration of sufficient interest, via some avenue such as a mailing list. rec.audio.car is not properly part of the rec.autos.* hierarchy. it is, however, the correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment, and so is mentioned here. rec.autos.antique is intended for the discussion of older cars (usually more than 25 years old, although this is not a hard-and-fast rule.) alt.hotrod is not part of the hierarchy, but also of potential interest to the rec.autos reader. it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing list, and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing performance vehicles. alt.autos.rod-n-custom also not part of the `official' hierarchy; devoted to that peculiar American hobby of customizing older cars. alt.autos.karting for the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby, karting. rec.autos is intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics. Crossposting: Crossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on the Newsgroups: line in the article header; such articles will appear in all of the newsgroups listed. Crossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on Usenet. You should only post to a group because you feel an article is appropriate; you should NEVER crosspost just to reach a particular audience. This distinction is subtle, but important. Radar Detector articles, for example, are more-or-less appropriate in rec.autos. They are almost never appropriate in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio, and the fact that you might want to reach the audience in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio is NOT adequate justification for posting to either group. Crossposting between any or all of the rec.autos.* groups is usually inappropriate; if you find yourself doing so, consider whether or not it is truly advisable, before sending your article. Consider setting Followup-To: to point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost. Crossposting between rec.autos.* and misc.consumers is chancy at best; in particular flame wars over the speed limit in the US and/or the use of radar detectors should NEVER be crossposted between any of these groups. Most readers of sci.electronics and rec.radio.* couldn't care less about the police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in rec.autos. It is an excellent idea to check the Newsgroups: and Followup-to: lines of articles before posting a followup. In particular, be wary of posting to misc.test, rec.arts.startrek.*, or talk.bizarre, or any combination of these three. The life you save may be your own. There is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to (partially) control where the article goes; it is called the Distribution field. It may be very useful for many reasons; it should also serve as a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system. The distribution of rec.autos.* is fairly extensive. As of this writing, the Automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and some locations in Japan. With this in mind, I offer the headers, and on article content. 1) Please take care not to send for-sale ads about clapped out Ford Mavericks in New Jersey to France or California; i doubt that anyone in either place will care, except for my girlfriend, who for some strange reason likes Mavericks (but only 4-door Mavericks, at that.) 2) When posting technical questions, please include the market for which your car was manufactured. For example, there are a number of differences between a European-market Ford Escort and a US-market Escort. Likewise, all 1750cc and early 2000cc Alfa Romeos reached the US with Spica Fuel injection; European market cars usually got carbs (often Webers). These differences can be important to your readers; make your situation clear. Failure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant spread of misinformation. 3) Be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting; in the US we get a mix of Metric and English system values, whereas Europe is almost entirely on the Metric system. A future edition of this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly-used abbreviations that may not be known in some places that rec.autos reaches; this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it. possible. Within North America, the values na (north america), can (canada), and usa may be used. in addition, the two-letter state abbreviations of the US are supported in some cases; e.g. if i wanted to send an article only to New York and New Jersey, i could put "ny,nj" in a Distribution field. note that multiple, comma-separated values are legal. these distribution fields vary widely, however, so you should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely to be supported in your area. The Dangers of Overgeneralization: To amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article: Be wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars, tires, etc. What is true for a 1973 Buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a 1976 Honda with a 1200cc engine. Headlight laws in Sweden are decidedly different from those in Idaho. The Need for Adequate Specification: When you ask a question, please give a reasonable amount of information; e.g., if you have a question about your Honda, please specify year, model, engine size, etc. Otherwise, most answers to your question may be quite useless. Concerning Lemons: At one time or another, every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or two; even Honda admits to this. Please don't waste everyone's time by announcing to the world that your `brand x' automobile is terrible, so all `brand x' automobiles are terrible, so no one should ever buy a car from the `brand x' company. Such articles are worse than useless, because they cause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful information. Concerning Flames: As much as we might wish it, a flame-free newsgroup is something that most likely will never occur. Here are some guidelines for flames and how to deal with them (a list of flame-prone topics follows in the next section of this posting): If you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory, don't imagine for a minute that including the words `No Flames' will work. It won't, and you'll get exactly what you deserve. If you're going to flame, you're more likely to get away with it if you can cite a fact or maybe a well-known reference. No one is likely to believe bald, unsupported assertions. Be careful about who you choose to insult. Consider not insulting anyone. Asking the Question: It is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like `Please send email, I don't read this group'. It is a much better idea to end the question with `Please send email, if there is sufficient interest I'll summarize the results in a later posting. I may miss posted responses to this request'. Answering the Question: If someone wants to hop up their Yugo, don't tell them to get a Mustang. Either be silent, or give them useful advice. If someone wants advice on defending a speeding ticket, don't tell them to obey the law next time -- it's offensive, presumes guilt which is not proven, and doesn't directly address the original question. In general, don't post in order to see your words in print, and don't post in order to enjoy feeling smug and self-righteous. Stale and/or Inflammatory Topics: Certain topics are considered stale by `old timers'; while discussion of them is certainly ok, and new, factual information is welcome, ravings about them are extremely tiresome, and may get the person who posts them ignored altogether. Some topics are naturally inflammatory; it is difficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them. Some of these topics include the following: 1) the 55mph speed limit in the US: Pro and Con 2) discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of radar detectors. 3) discussions over which radar detector is best. 4) discussions over what is a sports car (this is one reason why rec.autos.sport is not a `sports car' group -- everyone would argue about what constitutes a `sports car'.) 5) disputes over whether or not US Federal law protects the driver's right to own and operate a radar detector 6) `Buy American' discussions 7) `clever' bumper stickers and personalized license plates 8) <insert nationality here> cars are terrible 9) What kind of car did Maxwell Smart drive? [when I have a complete, accurate answer it will be added to the commonly-asked questions article which is also posted monthly. Until then, please don't waste bandwidth on this topic. -- rpw] Please direct comments and suggestions about this article to: welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com -- richard welty 518-393-7228 welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com ``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of a race car about either its pitch or roll axis'' -- Carroll Smith

X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1.4 PL6] Just found a great deal on a Clifford Delta car alarm, $450 installed. Comes with glass break sensor, motion detector, and shock detector. Does anyone have one of these alarms? Are they any good? From the looks of it, its about the best on the market for the price. It's also on sale, so that's another reason to get it. I think I'll be saving almost $200. Any opinions? Eric Lucas

I am fairly sure that placement of the >steering wheel was pretty much arbitrary to the company at that time..... By the 1920s, there was a very active "good roads" movement, which had its origins actually in the 1890s during the bicycle craze, picked up steam in the teens (witness the Linclon Highway Association, 1912 or so, and the US highway support act (real name: something different) in 1916 that first pledged federal aid to states and counties to build decent roads. Also, the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestic transport during WW 1 convinced the government that good raods were crucial to our national defense. Anyway, by the 20s there were plenty of good roads, at least around urban areas, and they were rapidly expanding into the countryside. This was the era, after all, of the first auto touring fad, the motel, the auto camp ground, etc. Two good books on the subject spring to mind - Warren Belasco "America on the Road" (title may not be exact - author is) and another called "The Devil Wagon in God's Country" author I forget. Also, any of John Flink's or John Bell Rae's auto histories. As to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary, by the early teens there were virtually no American cars that did not have the wheel on the left. In the early days, cars had the wheel on the left, on the right, and even in the middle, as well as sometimes having a tiller instead of a wheel. This was standardized fairly early on, though I don't know why.

Europe did seem on the brink of a 130kmh limit. It hasn't passed as far as I know. typical speeds in western europe are much higher than the US. Law enforcement is negligible in my experience (comapred to the US) as there is no revenue enhancement motivation. The things you really notice are the higher speed differentials, and the more professional attitude to driving. You just never see two cars running parallel at 55.1 mph oblivious to all around them. > >I strongly suspect you won't find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph >(nearly 200km/h) on the Autobahn, but I could be wrong. Some people You're wrong. GTI's go this fast. Just kind of noisy, not the ideal autobahn car. A lot of times you see cars being driven with the drivers foot on the floor.

If something happens at 130-150 you're dead, but the same goes for much over 35. Driving at high speed forces you to concentrate. I feel much safer driving 130+ on the autobahn than 60-80 in typical US traffic because most people seem to be awake. I've never seen any driver reading a book on an autobahn, I see it all too often in the US.

I still get caught off guard every now and then. Maybe I didnt word it right the first time. What I was trying to say was that if you plan to blow by somebody at a very HIGH speed differential and you assume you are safe because the guy sees you, you are stupid (of course, it depends on the circumstances). I have had some VERY scary instances when I assumed this and I dont think all of the fault was the other guy (now if he was going 25 in a 55 thats a whole different story)

They both had automatics. I'm a manual transmission bigot but I have to admit that the transmissions on these cars were better shifters than I am. And yes, they responded very quickly to kickdown requests. The Nissan had a tachometer so I was able to figure out which gear I was in. (The Olds may have also, but I don't remember.) I believe it shifted all the way down to second at about 50 mph when my foot told it, "No I really want to accelerate quickly." I would still prefer a manual, but I won't delude myself into thinking that I can out-accelerate a modern automatic.

The biggest hurdle for automatics (IMHO) is not shifting speed per se, but rather the transmission's reaction speed when you try to force it to shift manually. This was the biggest fault with the Subaru ECVT -- it took SOOOOOO LONNNNNNNNGGGGG for the tranny to find the right ratio. The sales propaganda says the Saturn automatic is effectively an electronically-shifted manual. Might this mean that Saturn has conquered the problem? (I dunno, only driven Saturn 5-speeds) INPUT, PLEASE! Another question: Any plans for a manual-trans Chrysler LH? Does anyone else out there fall asleep at night dreaming of this combo?

on wednesday morning, another driver decided to illegally turn left in front of me, doing great damage to my car (Honda Civic). i have yet to pay off the car, and the body shop says the insurance company wants to total the car. i haven't been able to get in touch with the person handling my claim, so i checked on some things: 1) my payout is $3700.00 2) Blue Book retail is $5650.00 3) loan value is $4450.00 4) trade-in value is $4000.00 could anyone give me any advice on what i should/could do if the insurance company does not give me a reasonable amount for the loss of the car. thanks, james baker baker@dfwvx1.dallas.geoquest.slb.com
o Subaru Service Manuals ................................... $10.00 This is not a complete set, but includes sections 4, 5 & 6 which cover MECHANICAL COMPONENTS (suspension, wheels & axles, steering, brakes, pedals & control cables, heater & ventilator, air conditioning), BODY (body & exterior, doors & windows, seats, seat belts, interior, instrument panel), and ELECTRICAL (engine electrical system, body electrical system, wiring diagram, and trouble-shooting). These are the genuine Subaru issue manuals. They are for model year 1986, but have plenty of good information that applies to other years as well. And, as long as I'm posting (end of car stuff), o Miscellaneous Darkroom Equipment ........................ $75.00 Solar enlarger (several objective lenses) with easel and timer, negative carriers for 35mm and 2 1/4 x 3 1/4, misc. printing masks. Developing tanks, thermometer, trays, constant-temperature bath, ground glass, mirrors, darkroom lamps, glassware, el-cheap-o tripods..... and (as they say) MUCH MORE! o Beautiful Antique Buffet ............................... $1500.00 Solid cherry (no veneer). Handmade, with very interesting dovetail corners in the drawers. Built (we think) around 1880. Not gaudy or covered with gew-gaws; a simple, elegant piece of furniture, but too big (60" long, 37" tall, 24" deep) for our little Cape Cod house.

The Chevrolet brothers were respected racers & test drivers for the Buick Co. when Durant was there. When the directors kicked Durant out of GM in 1910 he took Chevrolet and others with him. As mentioned before, they founded the successful Chevrolet company. A little-known fact is that the Chevrolet Co. actually took over GM! That was how Durant got back in charge of GM-- legally his new company Chevrolet Co. did the buying, and GM was a division of Chevrolet! After 1920 and into the Sloan era, GM shuffled things so that the GM board was superior, but there was always a degree of autonomy given the Chevy division, presumably because of the initial structure. (If you look at the organization chart for GM in Sloan's book, Chevy division reports directly to 14th floor, not through the "passenger car division" which covers Buick, Olds, Cadillac, and Oakland/Pontiac) -Jeff Hagen (minor deity of worthless auto-trivia) hagenjd@ac.wfu.edu

News-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41 Hi! A while back, there was a thread in this group about the use of the IWII in Europe (in countries with 50 Hz AC current). The consensus at the time was that the IWII would not work there. As I will be moving there this summer, I called Apple to make sure and they told me (today) that the IWII (as bought in the U.S.) will definitely run on 50 Hz AC current (as long as a step-down converter is employed if 240 V current is used). The same info, turns out, can be found in the IWII manual (p. 127 in the 1989 version), but I didn't really trust that. Does anyone have any direct experience to the contrary? Just wondering.

I seem to be having some trouble with this... I can get the mac to go to sleep, but I can't make seem to make it wake up with SetWUTime(). I am aware of the error in the header files and IM VI. I am setting the WU time to be about two minutes, then putting the mac to sleep, but it doesn't wakeup at the appointed time....

It would be interesting for Apple to come out with a NuBus PowerPC that allowed use of the CPU's 680x0, like RocketShare. But I guess that's getting a bit fantastic! I was wondering, since MacWeek reported that developers were 'seeded' with PowerPCs on a NuBus card. Also, any word on machine arrivals or estimated speed? Last I heard, the estimates were around 3-4 times the speed of a Quadra in native RISC mode. I heard an Apple employee mumble something about the arrival of PowerPC machines at a much earlier date that Q1 94, but I doubt it's true. Finally, is the PowerPC developer's CD 'mini-course' available? I saw it advertised in the developer's university calendar, and I'd like to know if it's at all *interesting*.

Hello all. I am thinking about buying an external monitor for my SE/30 and was wondering if anyone out in netland has any advice for me. I am mostly thinking about a 14" color monitor and an 8 bit card that can switch between 640*480 and something higher (like 800*600). I read an old report on a card from Lapis that could do this, but could not use the external monitor as the main screen (with menubar) which to me is a major draw- back. Has this perhaps been fixed? Or can any other cards do this (like the Micron Xceed) ? Also which monitor should I buy? At the moment I am leaning towards the Sony 1304, 1304s or 1320 (what exactly is the difference between these?) but are there any other good cheap monitors I should know about? Doesn't the monitor have to be multisync to support cards that can switch resolutions? Please send me e-mail and I'll summarize. I would also greatly appreciate getting the e-mail addresses of any mail order companys that sell monitors or cards. Thanks in advance Eggert Thorlacius University of Iceland

Disclaimer: This posting may contain no views at all News-Software: Usenet 3.1 I have tried almost everything under the sun to get a null modem connection between a Mac Duo 210 and a PC. I have used MacKermit and VersaTerm on the Mac side. I have used Procomm, Kermit, and Softerm (on OS/2) on the PC (or PS) side. I have used non-Hardware handshaking and hardware ahdshaking cables. And know MY hands are shaking from the effort. Nothing has allowed file transfers from the Mac to the PS. In general, I can type back and forth with no trouble, but only if both sides are set to speeds OVER 9600 baud. I cannot send files from the Mac to the PS at all, and file transfers from the Duo to the PS are not possible. When I do a straight ascii send, I can send from the PS to the Duo flawlessly. I can send Binhex files this way quite fast, and I know that the transmission is error free. But straight ascii sent from the Mac to the PS is full of errors. Unless, of course, I do text pacing so slow that it is like human typing. (well, like 2-3 times faster than human typing). I would like to hear from ANYONE who has been able to transfer files from a Duo 210 to a PS via modem or null modem. If you can do it, please tell me your EXACT combination of hardware and software. Obviously, I am talking of a true serial port modem, not the express modem. Maybe some kind soul with access to a modem and a Duo 210 can check this out for me. Right now, I am of the opinion that it won't work at high speeds because of the power interrupts on the Duo, and it won't work at low speeds because of some crazy reason I don't understand. Could I hear from someone attesting that they can really pump information out the serial port of a Duo 210 fast? Like via a modem or via a sys-ex dump? Could anyone with a Duo help me out?? I am going absolutely INSANE. I wanna know if the problem is MY Duo, or all Duo 210s, or all Duos, or just me. Yes, I have checked the cable 1,000,000 times. And not only can I type back and forth, but Zterm alerts the users if s/he uses hardware handshaking and CTS is down. So I know that hardware handshaking is working. And also, According to Zterm port stats, the buffer never overflows. Please help me figure out what's going on... Scott Petrack Petrack@haifasc3.vnet.ibm.com
I remember reading a thread a few days ago that mentioned removing an external syquest drive from its case and dropping it in the internal drive of a Centris. . . I was going to do that with my 610, but had a couple of questions. My PLI 80M syquest drive has a wire from the drive to an id# switch on the outside of the case. Where do I connect this switch?? Can the computer just "tell" with internal drives? I noticed that the drive will lay over part of the motherboard (I didn't look closely, but I seem to recall it laying over the ram that's soldered onto the motherboard? Would that cause problems? One last question! Is there anywhere to order a faceplate cover? the drive's front panel is smaller than the space left in the case (the drive's panel is the same size as the spotsBM clone's cases). Should I just cut a hole in the plastic panel that is currently holding tmpty place? Ans are welcomed! Thanks! Keith Moffatt KMOFFATT@VAX2.CSTP.UMKC.EDU

It would be an extremely hot idea...at least with the current Alphas. The available Alphas run up to 200 MHz. But they produce quite a bit of heat.

I've recently ordered a Centris 650 and need to decide on which modem to buy. I'm pretty sure I want to get a fax/data modem that can run at 14.4k, but is it worth it? I'll primarily only be 'conversing' over CompuServe or some other link to the Internet, but I'm not sure if those systems can supply ME with data at 14.4k. Another question I have is in some of the modem lingo out there. I understand baud rates, but what does V3.4 and V3.4bis mean? I could really use some suggestions as to what a good modem for around $300 would be, and why it would be a good choice. Thanks for your time.

The internal HD in my LC disappeared for a day last week, and I'd like to hear any (reasonable) theories folks can suggest for what happened. It is an LC, with 10MB of RAM and an 80MB internal drive, running system 7.1, with a few SCSI devices in a (so far as I know) properly terminated chain. I had shut down the system for a day-- I was out of town and we sometimes have thunderstorms this time of year-- and upon restarting got a blinking question mark. I booted from a floppy and saw that my external HD seemed okay, but there was no sign of the internal. I installed a system folder on the external and was, indeed, able to boot from it. I tried things like Disk First Aid and Silverlining, to inquire about the internal drive. They either could not find it or got errors in trying to talk to it. (Silverlining claimed it was a Connor drive, but it is a Quantum... ) Well, I'd backed things up, so I was able to work. But, at some point I noticed that the internal had reappeared. Now, Disk First Aid says that all's well, etc. Things seem to be fine. But, what happened? Was this a warning that something (the internal HD or something else) is about to die? I'm definitely nervous. And, if this is a signal that the internal HD is sick, is it true that I can only put up to a 127MB drive inside an LC? Some folks have claimed there's a limitation in the LC (other'n size or power) while others (and that includes LaCie, over the phone) say anything that fits is okay. Thanks for answers.
I have a 512k VRAM chip for sale. Worked fine in my LCII and will give 256 colors on 640 x 480 size screen. Asking $50. I'll cover postage.

Hello all, If anyone knows of a place to get the case to hold the power supply and motherboard of a Quadra 950 please let me know. I have tried some mail order places and some local stores. Both groups would prefer that I part with over $1000 to get just the case. In my eyes this seems about $600-$700 to much. Any comments? I currently own the guts of a 950. Please email me or post to this group w/ info, Thanks in advance, Andy

A fair number of brave souls who upgraded their SI clock oscillator have shared their experiences for this poll. Please send a brief message detailing your experiences with the procedure. Top speed attained, CPU rated speed, add on cards and adapters, heat sinks, hour of usage per day, floppy disk functionality with 800 and 1.4 m floppies are especially requested. I will be summarizing in the next two days, so please add to the network knowledge base if you have done the clock upgrade and haven't answered this poll. Thanks. Guy Kuo <guykuo@u.washington.edu>

Can anyone tell me what the difference is between a 256K DRAM chip and a 256K SIMM? I need the former (I think) to add memory to my Laserwriter LS. Someone is offering to sell me 256K SIMMS he removed from an SE, but I have a feeling this may not be the correct form of memory. The sockets in the Laserwriter look like they want the spidery-shaped chips (there are 4 sockets, each with, as I recall, 20 pins, arranged in two rows of 10). Believe it or not, I've never actually seen a SIMM.

Well folks, after some thought the answer struck me flat in the face: "Why would Apple release a Duo Dock with a processor of its own?" Here's why- People have hounded Apple for a notebook with a 68040 processor in it. Apple can't deliver that right now because the 040 saps too much power, radiates far too much heat, and is too large for a notebook. How does one get around that without designing a new chipset? Use existing PowerBook technology to your best advantage. The Duo Dock gives Apple a unique ability to give users that 040 power in a "Semi-Portable" fashion. By plunking the 040 into the Dock, you've got "quadra" power at your desk. On the road, that 33mhz 68030 should be able to handle most of your needs. Okay, not the BEST solution, but its an answer to a no-win situation. :-) So, does this mean one will be able to use the PowerBook's processor in parallel to the dock's processor? Okay, we're getting REALLY hypothetical now... -- Travis Grundke | MacGames Digest- Your #1 Source for Information, Contributing Editor, | News & Reviews of Gaming Software and the Gaming MacGames Digest | Industry in the Macintosh Community.
